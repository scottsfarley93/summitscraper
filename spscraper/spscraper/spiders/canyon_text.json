The turn off is not signed, just measure the distance and as soon as you pass the culvert take the dirt road heading east. The road drives straight back from the highway about 100 meters then it drops and ends into a wash next to a sandstone wall.

Use your route finding skills, but nothing should exceed class 3. I put a few cairns up there just for fun. The slick rock will become less steep, continue always towards the highest point you can see. This section of approach trail is very beautiful and gives you nice views into the lower Blarney drainage on your right (see the first photo overview section), and great views of Henry Mountains in the distance. You will pass several little summits on slick rock and reach a big rock face, the trail will re-emerge here in a sand/dirt. Skirt around the left (west) side of the rock face on a good and easy to follow trail. The trails levels here, you will reach another slick rock section, and trail will re-emerge again after getting back onto the dirt section. Cairns mark the trail on slick rock. The route finding was pretty obvious. The trail continues in northerly direction and you will get nice views into the Blarney on your right, and into the Shillelagh Canyon on your left. The trail goes up following the rim of the Blarney canyon. At the junction, continue right towards the head of Left Fork of Blarney (going left would take you to Shillelagh Canyon).

You can see a flat area with a large boulder with webbing below you - nice re-assuring mark. \u00a0Rappel 1: Anchor is a large boulder with webbing and rappel ring (in good condition April 2016 - always check and carry extra webbing with you in case replacement or back up is needed).

I opted down climbing into this slot, which may appear scary for some, but was not that bad. There is an opening under the choke stone on the right side and several good footholds. Climbing over the choke stone is more exposed and sketchy. I any case, if members of your party are concerned, there are boulders there for setting up a rappel. Use good judgement here.\u00a0There are several down climbs in this section up to 3-4 meters high. I felt comfortable, but can imagine unexperienced people asking for some assistance.\u00a0Rappel 2 or 3 (depending whether you rappelled above) into a dark chamber: There was single webbing extended over a choke stone. The start of this rappel felt awkward and the webbing appeared older (may need replacement soon). This rappel is 15 meters - 50 feet long. This area has some darker and narrow sections of the slot and several down climbs. Some may need assistance on these down climbs, even setting up another rappel station. I did not find it very challenging. This was a really nice slot area.\u00a0Junction with the Right Fork of Blarney is about 0.3 miles down canyon of rap 2.

This canyon is simply one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.  The experience of being there and seeing the dancing colors and feeling the smooth sandstone underneath your fingers as you trail them along the walls is very uplifting and spiritual.  This is a place every person should visit before they die to see the fantastic work of Mother Nature.\r\n\r\nAntelope Creek enters Lake Powell about 3 miles east of Page, Arizona at an elevation of about 4,000 feet, and for most of its course it flows through a wide sandy wash that's not particularly scenic.

The first one is located in the mouth of the canyon just inside the forest, 4 sites along the creek, and one more good site after crossing the primitive bridge. All of these spots are near North Holmes Creek so un-purified water is available. Since Adams is more of a day hike, at least one of them are usually available. ", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\nAdams Canyon Route Map\u00a0\nPrimitive Bridge across Holmes Creek\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdams Canyon (sometimes called North Holmes Creek), located near Hwy 89 in Layton is an extremely popular hike into the canyon, through the forest and up to a 40 foot waterfall. In the evenings during the summer, there is upwards of 50 people on the trail and pretty much everyone in Layton Utah has climbed Adams Canyon at least once. \n\nThat being said, there is good reason for its popularity. First, it is difficult enough to be challenging without being brutal. Secondly, the hike through the canyon is a beautiful example of Northern Wasatch forest. Finally, seeing the waterfall is a statisfying reward for the effort. \n\nThis 3.8 mile round-trip hike can be accomplished year around, although it can get a little sporty in the winter with light scrambling, sloughing through drifts, and steep trails covered in ice sheets. Fall trips up the canyon feature some pretty spectacular color changes while spring shows off nice wildflowers. The forest portion of the hike is fairly cool in the summer but the lower portion going up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail is a sandy, sun swept series of switchbacks which generally makes that part of the trip fairly unpleasant during high summer. Bring water!\n\nThe hike to the waterfall is broken up into three segments. From the Trailhead to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (sandy switchbacks), from the BST to river crossing (pleasant forest hiking), from the crossing to the waterfall (rocky trail and light scrambling). All total, it is 1.93 miles trailhead to the waterfall with a 1,420 foot elevation gain. \n\nGETTING TO THE WATERFALL\n\nFrom the trailhead parking lot proceed up the sandy switch backs. There\u2019s only one trail from the trailhead, so it\u2019s impossible to miss. This portion up the west face of the hill is hot and dry. After about .6 mile, you will reach Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST). The trail will split left, up, or right. Go right, into the canyon for another \u00bc mile and the trail splits again. The right branch crosses a bridge, continues South on the BST to Kaysville and, ultimately, Provo 90 miles to the south. DON\u2019T CROSS THIS BRIDGE! Continue on the left fork into the canyon forest and enjoy the hike for another .6 mile until your reach a primitive bridge--a large log with boards nailed on to it. Cross the bridge (or ford the stream) and continue following the trail. At this point the trail becomes kind of confusing as hundreds of people have chosen different methods of going toward the waterfall. Simply follow the path that looks closest to you hiking skills staying along the creek and heading \u201cup\u201d. After .3 miles you will cross the creek again (during the Spring you will get your feet wet, plan accordingly). The waterfall is on your right! Enjoy the view and retrace your trip up back to the trailhead. Hardcore, in shape people do Adams round-trip in less than 1.5 hours, average hikers in around 2. If you haven't been working out, plan on 3 hours. \n\nHike Details:\nMain Trailhead: Adams Canyon Trailhead (41.066216,-111.909978) \nDistance: ~3.8 Round trip \nVertical Gain: ~1,420 Feet\nHike time: ~2+ hoursHazards:Just because everyone in Layton Utah has climbed Adams Canyon, it is not totally safe.\u00a0 The most common hazards are slips, spills and falls.\u00a0 The trail is rocky and steep in areas.\u00a0 Spring is a especially hazardous as the trail in the canyon is an ice sheet.

There, by a smelly outhouse, the Heaton Flat Trail (designated 8W16) begins on your right.  This is the first option for getting to Allison Mine.  Hike up this trail for 3.3 miles to a saddle at 4,582' elevation.  Just beyond the saddle, you will locate a faint use trail on your left.  This use trail, very overgrown in parts, traverses the slope for 3 miles to reach Allison Mine.\r\n\r\nYour second option, more of a navigational challenge than the first route above,  is to continue past the Heaton Flat Trail junction and proceed up the East Fork of the river (lots of river crossing to be done here) a little over 2.5 miles to where Allison Gulch joins the river.  You must be very careful to make sure you have the right canyon; the entrance to Allison Gulch is about 200 yards past a large cliff on the left side of the river known as Swan Rock. Navigating up Allison Gulch from this point can be tricky so consult a detailed route source (one source is Adventure Hikes and Canyoneering in the San Gabriels) before you attempt this route.

The bus from Hania to Hora Sfakion departs every day at 8.30 am, 11.00 am and 2.00 pm. \r\nThe road from Hania to Sfakia crosses the island from North to South, through the village of Vrises. At the 33rd km of the road Hania-Rethymnon you should leave the main motorway and follow a paved side road to Vrises. From this village starts an impressive trip to the east side of the White Mountains crossing the mountainous area of Sfakia and ending to Hora Sfakion by the Lybian sea. Half way from Vrises to Hora Sfakion is the fertile plateau of Askifou, surrounded by high mountain peaks. \r\nFrom Askifou plateau to Hora Sfakion is the most impressive part of the route.

The Aradena Gorge is one of the neighbors from the famous Samaria gorge. This gorge is for hikers that prefer a peaceful walk instead of being with a 2000 other walking fans in Samaria. Generally, the Aradena gorge is quite relaxed but is not for people without any walking experience. Many passages require a good deal of surefootedness, especially if you are walking downwards. Also, in the past the walk through the gorge used to be considered difficult because of a high passage in the upper part of the gorge which had to be negotiated with a rope. About 10 years ago a solid metal ladder (famous ladder of Aradena) was attached to the cliff instead of the rope, making the passage easy - as long as you do not suffer from fear of heights (it is about 10-12 meters high). Three years ago, a path was built which avoids the ladders and makes it a little bit more comfortable for people with fear of heights. But beware; although this new path has a handrail it is not appropriate if you suffer from vertigo. Near the end of the path the Aradaina bridge crossing the gorge.

While it doesn't compare to the great canyons of the Mediterrenean like Restonica on Corsica, Samaria on Crete or Gorrupu on Sardinia it has a little bit of everythingbut - on a smaller scale. The Avakas Gorge is about 5km long and carved out of the surrounding chalk and limestone down to about 100m. In its narrowest passages you can almost touch both walls with your hands and in its most scenic location a big chockstone is wedged between the walls high above. While the Akamas Peninsula is absolutely dry for most of the year in the little canyon you'll find running water all year round, indicating the forces that created the gorge in the first place.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAvakas Gorge might seem like a logical destination on a hot day but take care: though in permanent shade the narrow sections still heat up considerably and the humidity of the creek inside will raise the humidity levels. We found the athmosphere stifling (yes we hiked the gorge on a hot day in May), especially where the omnipresent goats and pigeons left their droppings. Moreover, the upper part of the canyon is rather open and exposed to sun and weather.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe gorge entry, hidden between fruit plantations, is still rather wide. Everywhere you will find Oleander bushes marking the pools and puddles left from the creek which runs through the canyon. While the gorge narrows down to about 5m the walls rise up, often leaving little trace of the sunlight. Here you'll find droves of pidgeons nesting high up on the walls and leaving their traces right down to the canyon floor, where larbe boulders often block the way. After about 2km the gorge opens, the walls retreat but get higher and the sunlight offers more spots where vegetation can grow. You often have to fight your way through the oleander bushes, while negotiating the boulders on the ground. Goats take over from the pidgeons with similar results on the ground. In this section the canyon is some 300m wide.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn the topmost part the walls retreat further leaving only a slightly pronounced creek bed. Orientation gets more and more difficult since it gets hard to distinguish the main bed from the ones of tht tributaries. There is a goat farm with a plantation of huge olive trees, which marks the end of the canyon.

It lies just to the north of Farmington Canyon, and is easily accessed via US 89. As with many of the canyons in this area, scrub oak and mountain mohagany dominate. Bair Creek runs down the bottom of the canyon, and in some areas has cut large washes out of the canyon sides, making the trail a bit sketchy, but not difficult. This is a very popular place, so making sure you are on the right trail is important. There are many little cut-offs here and there, some are game trails, some are shortcuts to the creek, some are dead ends, so be careful. Even though you are not in a remote area, and there are plenty of people around, this is still a very rugged area. The trail is a haven for rattlesnakes, and have been seen as far up as the top of the ridge. \r\n\r\nThe canyon was named after John Bair, and early settler in the Fruit Heights area. He owned a sawmill in the approximate location of the present day Rock Loft. \r\n\r\nThe canyon is known most though as the route of the famous Crazy Bob's Bair Gutsman Race. This trail running race has been going on for over 30 years, and is not to be taken lightly. It starts at an  LDS church 1 mile south of the trailhead to the canyon, runs up the canyon to the ridgeline about a mile north of the radar towers on Francis Peak. It then follows the road south of the towers to the top of Farmington Canyon. Distance is between 11-12 miles, and must be finished in 5 hrs or less. \r\n\r\nThe trail starts at and elevation of around 4,900 ft, and climbs approximately 4 miles to an elevation of 9,100 ft at the ridge top road. The final .75 miles to the top of the canyon and ridge is the steepest. This area is know as Heartbreak Hill. Maps show some switchbacks, but I couldn't find them, and the only trail I saw and used, goes straight up the ridge. It's more of a wash than anything. \r\n\r\nIt's a great canyon to hike up if you are bagging any of the peaks in the area, such as Thurston or Francis. There are great views west over Farmington Bay, and east into the Morgan Valley.It's not technical in anyway, but it is strenuous and I would recomend hiking it in the spring and fall months.

The canyon is fairly wide and open at this point. As you head downstream, however, the canyon will begin narrowing pretty quickly. Soon you will find yourself able to touch both canyon walls at the same time having to squeeze through sections. This is where the best narrows of the route are found. \r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout 30 minutes from where you first reached the canyon bottom, you will come to the first of 3 rappels. It is a short, 15 foot rappel. There is an existing anchor, but be sure to check the webbing to make sure it looks safe. This goes for the other 2 rappels as well. You may need to add an additional sling and remove an old one. There are more great narrow sections below the first rap. \r\n\r\nAbout 10 minutes from the first rappel, is the second rappel. This is an 80' rap with an awkward start. This is an intimidating rappel for beginners. This rappel is located where Baptist Draw plunges into Upper Chute Canyon.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of the 2nd rappel, there are two options. One can take a short detour go upstream (left) and explore the narrows in Upper Chute Canyon for a bit and then return to the bottom of the 2nd rap. Or, one can just continue on the route downstream. The 3rd rappel comes quickly after entering Upper Chute Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd rappel is another short, 20' rap. People have opted to skip the rap and downclimb here, but it is not recommended. The consequences are too great and this is a very remote area. Help is a very long ways away.\r\n\r\nBelow the 3rd rap, the canyon begins to open up a bit and it becomes much deeper than in the Baptist Draw section. There are several sections below the 3rd rap that fill with water. The level can range a great deal from waist high to completely dry. The water is often filthy and smells horrible. It can also be freezing cold despite very hot air temperatures.\r\n\r\nRoughly 1 hour from the second rappel, Upper Chute Canyon opens up. There is a drainage leading off to the right hand side (facing down stream) with a sandy cattle trail. This is Fault Line Canyon where you will leave Upper Chute canyon and begin your return. Follow Fault Line Canyon for roughly 2 miles (about 1 hour). You will see a drainage to the right hand side (facing up canyon). Climb this drainage to the top of mesa and walk north to you get to its rim. You will see a fairly wide valley below. The trailhead is across this valley. Find one of several cattle paths crossing the valley and climb to the rim of the opposite mesa. The trailhead should be a little north and east of here. \r\n\r\nIt is easy to get disoriented here. There are few distinctive landmarks and much of the terrain looks similar. I strongly suggest taking a GPS and marking your car. It also helps to walk from your car to on overlook of this last valley before starting the hike. This way you will be more familiar with the area on your return and it will make the route finding easier.

The gorge is home to an established wilderness area that makes up a little over 3,700 acres. Since the area was logged to the bare ground at the turn of the century, there are no groves of virgin forest. However, the woods have recovered nicely and the entire area is clothed in dense forests of various types, depending on the varied terrain and proximity to flowing water.\r\n\r\nBald River itself is a medium-sized tributary, but free-flowing and very clean. It descends through the gorge along flats and down cascades and over some impressive falls, including Bald River Falls, which is arguably the most beautiful and impressive waterfall in the state of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nFishing is very popular in this region, and many anglers head into the Bald River Gorge to try their luck. With ample campsites along the trail that runs the length of the wilderness, it can be difficult to find solitude sometimes. In addition, Forest Service Road 210 runs along the northern boundary of the wilderness, allowing roadside access to the major falls, so it can be very crowded at that trailhead.

You will most likely see no or very little water in the riverbed, as the gully discharges the rainwater from the seasonal storms very rapidly. At various points there are narrower side gullies. You can explore a little bit, but most of them are too overgrown to allow it. I would recommend to just continue straight ahead and enjoy the scenery.\n\nThe riverbed, close to highway 140D\n\nNear the trail head is a strange monument which gives name to the gully. It originally consisted of four stone pillars on a meander, one of which has collapsed into the riverbed. On one of the stones you can read: \"These pillars were made in the year of 1889 under mayor Mr. Manuel Rosas / Commisioner of plumbing Mr. Domingo Porras\".\nThe riverbed is sandy, but not too difficult to walk in. There are a few shortcuts with firmer ground at some points. One of the most beautiful parts comes after some 1.2 km, where you can find a nice ocote (Montezuma pine) forest with enough shade to relax while listening to the singing birds. This place is also best suited for camping.\n\nPine forest\n\nFederal highway 140D crosses the gully on a bridge after 2.5 km. While you may encounter an occasional shepherd on the lower parts, the part beyond the bridge is pretty much always deserted, which increases the probability of fauna sightings, mostly cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus cunicularius).\nYou can return at any given point of the hike. If your goal is to climb La Malinche via Xaltonalli mountain, you should start heading west at some point in order to reach the Tepulco trail. For more information, see: Neyra J\u00e1uregui, Jorge A. Gu\u00eda de las altas monta\u00f1as de M\u00e9xico y una de Guatemala. Mexico City (2012): CONABIO. p. 219. I will update this information if I find out about it someday.\n\nOne of the shortcuts\n\n", "Season": "Summer", "Getting There & General Recommendations": "The easiest way to reach the trail head is by car. Take the federal highway 129 (Amozoc-Teziutl\u00e1n-Nautla). In Acajete, turn uphill/northwest at Calle 12 Norte\u00a0and continue straight ahead, keeping your right. After some 2 km there is a shield: Los Pilares to the left. Note that this doesn't mean the gully but a recreation park with the same name, so you must continue to the right. After 2 more km, the road splits. The right continues uphill, while the left takes you down the gully. You can park your vehicle there. I would advise you to leave a visible note inside the car, something like \"Fuimos a explorar la ca\u00f1ada\" stating date and time, as some locals in rural Mexico will report unknown and perceivedly abandoned vehicles to the police.\nIf you don't have a car, you must take an intercity bus and ask the driver to drop you off in Acajete, then continue by foot. As most Mexicans are still decades from understanding the importance of proper waste disposal, I would advise you against getting into the gully at an earlier point (i.e. at 19\u00b006'50.6\"N 97\u00b056'52.5\"W) \u2014\u00a0to save you from unpleasant, waste-ridden sights.\nThe best time to explore Los Pilares is during the summer months because of how green everything turns. Look at the weather forecast for Acajete, pick a day with little probability of precipitation, and arrive early. The best chances are during the can\u00edcula (dog days) from mid-July to early August, as well as mid-October through November, just after the end of the wet season.\n"},

Cliffs up to one hundred feet high, making them among Shenandoah's tallest, line the rims and present numerous toproping and trad climbing possibilities in a wild, remote (for this part of the country) setting.  In places, dense stands of mountain laurel line both sides of the trail that accesses the canyon, making late May and early June some of the prime times to visit.\r\n\r\nA trail follows the east rim of the canyon all the way to the park boundary, beyond which (or from which) there is no legal public access due to private-property concerns.  As the trail follows the rim, there is a stretch that skirts the clifftops and provides outstanding unrestricted views of the canyon, its west-side cliffs, and the rolling hills beyond.  There used to be a trail through the canyon itself, but floods kept destroying the trail.  It is still possible, however, to follow its faint remnants back up through the canyon or just to scramble/bushwhack along.  Awesome route-finding skills aren't required; all one has to do is follow the stream to the head of the canyon until you are back on the trail.  Also, consider scrambling up the west side of the canyon and returning to the main trail system via rugged terrain full of deadfall, dense undergrowth, and rock outcrops.  The going this way is harder but is rewarding due to the wilderness feel and the nice views of the cliffs of the east rim.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs of the east rim are taller and steeper than those of the west rim, and they are easier to access since a trail crosses the top of them.  If you like climbing in a wilderness setting and don't mind hauling your gear for about 2 miles, this is a nice place for you.  But if your goal is just to climb something and a long approach is undesirable, consider going to Little Stony Man Cliffs instead, where you will find the longest and the best climbing in the park, and plenty of hiking company.\r\n\r\nRoute Details: One-way distance via the maintained trails is 3.4 miles, almost all downhill.

The trail gets plenty of traffic during the winter and you shouldn't need snowshoes on the lower portion of the trail (although it does get icy and snowshoes could be handy).  Spring comes a little later to Beus than the rest of Ogden because of the natural shading of the forest; expect snow to be present thru April. \r\n\r\nOverall, the trail is straightforward and doesn't have a lot of side trails that confuse the heck out of people.  All cross-road/side-trail issues are solved with \"Keep Right/Go Up\".  There is only one trail from the trailhead and you pass an info kiosk and sign that says 5.6 miles to Ogden Saddle. From there, the trail goes steadily (but not steeply) up the canyon. At the 1/2 mile point the trail splits with the left fork going onto the Bonneville Shoreline Trail and all Ogden points North.  The Right Fork (stay on this) crosses a bridge and continues into the canyon. At about 1 mile, you will reach a small 25 foot waterfall next to the trail. Continuing up, you cross the creek twice and the forest becomes more Aspen and less Oak.  At about 2 miles, you will reach the fern fields that go for about another 1/2 mile...these fern fields are incredibly thick, you may need a machete in the summer.  During the fall, the fern feilds are much less imposing and the trail is easy to navigate.  Recent trail maintenance has greatly improved the trail above the waterfall and widened the trail through the fern feilds.  Once you run out of fern field, you've ran out of canyon. From there, the trail goes steeply up the side of the mountain (south) and up to Mt Ogden (About 3 miles to the North East). \r\n\r\n \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Apr4,2011/Dec9,2011", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=41.18082&amp;distance_lon_9=-111.90315&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">41.18082\u00b0N/111.90315\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "None.

{"Activities": "Hiking,TradClimbing,Bouldering,IceClimbing,AidClimbing,BigWall,Scrambling", "Inner Canyon Hikes": "\r\nIt felt so great to stand there and listen to the running water. The top of the canyon felt like a winter, and there was still autumn at the bottom of the canyon. Hiking in the inner canyon is not for beginning hikers. There are a number of routes to and along the river in the National Park. These routes do not have switchbacks; all are very steep, most dropping 1600 feet or more in 1 mile. None are maintained. The Gunnison is a very swift and cold river (38\u00b0 F), with changing river flows based upon upstream dam releases.  Swimming, wading or hiking across the river are not recommended.  The park service cautions that it is your responsibility to find your own way and be prepared for self-rescue.  The Trails Illustrated\u00ae map #245, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park may prove useful (though it does not include inner canyon campsites within most of the national park).  \r\n\u00a0\r\nNPS backcountry hiking map (extract).\r\nHiking through the canyon is very difficult and not recommended.  Many places have precipitous cliffs that impede any type of hiking along the river.  There are no trails, and a trip of this type requires braving narrow ledges, and swimming or wading in the river between swift moving rapids.  Visitors are strongly advised not to swim, wade or hike across the river except in a boat or kayak, and only in certain places.  However, there are sections of the canyon where it is possible for the most experienced backcounty traveler to hike.  Seek the advice of a ranger before attempting this type of experience.  \r\n\r\nSome side canyons not described below may also offer hikes to the river.  The NPS recommends taking the established routes (all described below) first.  Check with a ranger for more information on alternative routes, and for detailed descriptions.  All off route travel is difficult and navigation can be extremely challenging.  \r\n\r\nGood LNT practices are to be followed.  Some additional wilderness use rules:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Wood fires are prohibited.  If a fire ring is found in the inner canyon, don't use it.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Pets are not allowed.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Use pit toilets, if available.  If not, bury all human waste in 6\u201d deep holes at least 100 feet from the river. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Packing out all trash includes toilet paper, too.  \r\n\r\nIf hiking these routes in the winter, be prepared with snowshoes, crampons and an ice axe.  Most South Rim routes are snow-covered from November to April.  North Rim routes can be snow free as early as February.  Contact the park for current conditions.  \r\n\r\nAll use of the backcountry (including day hiking) requires a free permit. These are available at the South Rim visitor center, North Rim ranger station and at the East Portal registration board.  Permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis.  At each location there are self-registration stations with instructions.  Carry your permit while in the backcountry.  Check out with a ranger, or by returning the permit to the self-registration box.  \r\n\r\nSouth Rim\r\n\r\nGunnison Route is the most popular route; however it is still strenuous.  This route is recommended to persons attempting their first inner canyon hike.  The route begins at the South Rim visitor center.  Follow the Oak Flat Trail for 1/3 mile, down the first few switchbacks.  When you come to a sign that says \u201cRiver Access.  Permit Required.\u201d, continue the steep descent to the 80-foot chain located 1/3 of the way down the drainage.  An outhouse and campsites are located a short distance upstream.  One-way distance: 1 mile.  Vertical drop:  1800 ft.  Campsites:  3. \r\n\r\nTomichi Route is considered the steepest South Rim route and is difficult. To find this route, park near the South Rim Campground.  Take the Rim Rock Nature Trail to post #13.  This is the start of the Tomichi Route.  Descend the route until the junction with another draw is reached.  Continue to follow the main drainage down the slope to the river.  The entire route is loose rock and receives full sun exposure.  Use extra caution while descending.  One-way distance:  1 mile.  Vertical drop:  1960 feet.  Campsites: 2. \r\n\r\nWarner Route is the longest and overnight travel is highly suggested.  To find this route, hike along the Warner Point Nature Trail and walk up the hill past post #13.  Look for a large Utah serviceberry bush on the left that is marked with a small silver sign titled, \u201cServiceberry Bush\u201d.  This is the start of the Warner Route.  The path leads off to the left.  Avoid the first drainage and continue west to the lowest saddle on the ridge before descending.  Campsites are located up and downstream.  One-way distance:  2.75 miles.  Vertical drop:  2722 ft.  Campsites:  5. \r\n\r\nNorth Rim Routes\r\n\r\nLong Draw, formerly called Devil's Slide, brings the hiker into one of the narrowest parts of the canyon where the walls tower above the swiftly moving Gunnison River.  To find this route, park at Balanced Rock Overlook, then walk northeast to the bend in the road.  The descent begins at the road.  \u00a0\r\nLong Draw Bivouac.Pass through a small area of box elder trees at the rim and scramble down the gully to the river.  There is plenty of poison ivy along the bottom of this route.  There are also short ledges to climb (8-12 ft).  One-way distance:  1 mile.  Vertical drop:  1800 ft.  Campsites:  1. \r\n\r\nSOB Draw is suggested for the first time North Rim inner canyon hiker.  To find this route, park vehicles in the pull-through near the campground registration board, or at the North Rim ranger station.  The route begins at the access ladder along the fence line just east of the campground.  This is on the right side of the road when traveling from the ranger station to the campground.  Follow the path to the top of the drainage gully and descend on the far right of the route.  The route has short ledges to climb (8-12 ft).  The campsites are located downstream a short distance.  SOB Draw is famous for its abundant poison ivy. Long pants are recommended.  One-way distance:  1.75 miles.  Vertical drop:  1800 ft.  Campsites:  6. \r\n\r\nSlide Draw is extremely steep and the most potentially dangerous route due to loose rock and poor footing.  To find this route, park at Kneeling Camel View, then walk east until you reach the head of the draw.  Slide Draw requires a 30-foot downward climb to start the route.  Follow the draw to the river, taking extra caution due to the abundance of loose rock underfoot.  A good camping area is found at the river.  One-way distance:  1 mile.  Vertical drop:  1620 ft.  Campsites:  2. \r\n\u00a0\r\nDevil's Backbone trailhead at East Portal. \r\nEast Portal Routes\r\n\r\nDevil's Backbone Route is a hike along the river.  Park at the East Portal Campground.  Hike downstream on the south side for about 1/2 mile until you reach the ridge that runs down the cliff. The top 30 feet of this 400-foot scramble is a bit exposed and a rope could be useful. The rocks are slippery with gravel on top, and you are exposed to the edge of the cliff. The downstream side is more gentle. You can hike another mile downstream scrambling the smaller ridgelines. \r\n\r\nNorth River Route is accessed after parking at the East Portal Campground.  There is a small boat launch at the registration board that provides a good landing for boating access across the river for this route. Once across the river you can hike nearly 2 miles down river to the cliff at Flat Rock Rapid. There is one low ridge to scramble over at Deadhorse Gulch. \r\n\r\nRed Rock Canyon\r\n\r\nThe hike into Red Rock Canyon at the western end of the park (map) is not easy, but it is significantly less steep than other inner canyon routes to the river.  One-way distance: 3.4 miles.  Vertical drop: 1330 feet.\r\n\r\nReservations, which are awarded by lottery, are required for all persons entering Red Rock Canyon (including day hikers).  Reservation lottery request forms must have been received at the park headquarters during the specified January to March time-frame for the upcoming hiking season (see link below for details).  In the past, only about one-quarter to one-third of the lottery applications have been honored before the seasonal quota was filled, making first come, first serve access highly unlikely.  Check the NPS Red Rock Canyon web page for the most current information and the form (when it becomes available).  \r\n\r\nThe permitted season runs from mid-May to early October; there is no public access at other times of the year.  Maximum stay is limited to 3 days and 2 nights per visit.  Group size is limited to 4 people, whether hiking or camping.  Parking is limited to 3 vehicles at any given time.  Carpooling is recommended.  Part of the road and parking lot for the trailhead are located on private land.  While on private property, please be respectful.  Smoking is not allowed on the private road.  An entrance fee of $7.00 per person will be charged at the trailhead, but read the NPS web page linked above for options when that fee is not required (passes, fee paid at South Rim, etc).  ", "Bouldering": "\u00a0\r\nLocating Marmot Rocks (Google\u00ae Earth image).\r\nRated as # 28 on the bouldering guide (available for free at the visitor center).Marmot Rocks\r\n\r\nMarmot Rocks are an excellent set of boulders along the South Rim Drive between Painted Wall and Cedar Point Overlooks.  Park at the Painted Wall Overlook, and then hike along the road until it bends to the right.  Look for a worn path on the left (south).  Follow this path to the boulders, about 100 feet south of the road.  Marmot Rocks are not marked on the NPS or the Trails Illustrated\u00ae maps, but you can see them on the image to the right (See on Google\u00ae Earth:  38\u00b0 34' 40.43\" N, 107\u00b0 43' 01.77\" W).  The rocks are clearly visible, as is the nearby road.  \r\n\r\nThe rock is generally very solid but rough.  Easy routes tend to follow good crack systems, while the harder ones are usually steep to overhanging faces.  The routes are from 10 to 20 feet high and, though some are excitingly high off the ground, the landings are almost always clear and level.  Specific descriptions of the routes from the National Park Service are (based on this diagram of Marmot Rocks):\r\n\u00a0\r\nNPS Marmot Rocks bouldering diagram.\r\nBoulder A\r\n\r\n1 - Moderate.  The right edge or arete of the front (north) face has a line of holds up the arete, with a hard finish.  The route is considerably easier if one stems over to the flake on route 2.  This and the next route are identified by prominent black streaks.\r\n\r\n2 - Difficult.  Follow the strenuous, left-curving flake left of route 1.  Finish straight up after the hard initial moves, or for a bigger challenge keep your hands on the flake and follow it left to its end.\r\n\r\n3 - Difficult.  A contrived route following small holds and vague seams just right of the obvious crack of route 2, staying away from the crack as long as possible.\r\n\r\n4 - Easy.  The right two cracks on the left side of the back wall.\r\n\r\nBoulder B\r\n\r\n5 - Difficult.  The west face (overhanging and forming a chimney passage with boulder A) has an off-width crack starting from a horizontal crack halfway up its left side.  Do not use the back wall (boulder A), of course, except to retreat when you've had enough.  \r\n\r\n6 - Difficult.  The southwest corner of B has some holds that start a strenuous and tricky route, that inishes up the south face.  \r\n\r\n7 - Very Difficult.  Perhaps the most difficult natural line here.  The route climbs small flakes on the southeast corner to gain a righ facing flake/finger crack.  Good luck getting off the ground!  \r\n\r\n8 - Moderate.  Start as for route 5, but use the horizontal crack to reach around the corner left and climb the northwest arete.\r\n\r\nBoulder C\r\n\u00a0\r\nMarmot Rocks bouldering.\r\n9 - Moderate/Difficult.  The left side of the west face (facing boulder B) has a continuous thin face with small flakes.  There are several ways to climb it.  Watch for the fragile holds.  \r\n\r\n10 - Difficult/Very Difficult.  Another contrived route up the right side of the west face, avoiding the good holds to the left.  Stay off the low-angle arete to the right as long as possible.  \r\n\r\n11 - Easy/Moderate.  Follow the southwest arete, using the thin flaring crack and face holds.\r\n\r\n12 - Easy.  A crack/ramp 4 off the ground followed by a low angle face climbing presents a number of easy routes.  \r\n\r\nBoulder D\r\n\r\n13 - Difficult.  The climbs are directly up to and past an obvious white hold on the right side of the front face.  \r\n\r\n14 - Easy.  A nice crack in a slight corner, becoming two cracks at the top.\r\n\r\n15 - Difficult.  Climb the subtly steeping face just right of route 14 (without using that crack) using a right-facing flake to get started.  Then go straight up or right (easier).  A fall at the top puts you in the oak tree!\r\n\r\n16 - Difficult.  The crack on the southwest corner of boulder D, overhanging at the bottom.  Strenuous.  \r\n\r\n17 - Moderate.  Right of route 16 is a ledge or ramp running up right above an overhanging section.  Gain this (it helps if you're tall), then get your feet on it.  \r\n\r\n18 - Difficult.  Climb the face immediately right of the route 17 crack, not using that crack or hold immediately next to it.  The horizontal, thin flake/crack is used to make a move leading to the finish up and left.  \r\n\r\n19 - Easy/Moderate.  A crack ramp five feet off the ground provides a number of routes starting with a mantle, then up rounded face holds to finish.  \r\n\r\nBouldering at Other Than Marmot Rocks\r\n\r\nYou must notify park staff before any sustained bouldering activity in any area other than Marmot Rocks.  They will then approve bouldering activity in the proposed area based on likely impacts to park resources, the proposed access route, and to other visitor activities and the overall visitor experience.", "Camping": "\r\nNorth Rim CampgroundThere are three campgrounds available in (and through) the national park.

This trail allows exploration below the rim without actually hiking into the canyon.  It is narrow and has steep drop-offs in places.  The trailhead is near the visitor center.  \r\n\r\nNorth Rim\r\n\r\nDeadhorse Trail, at 6.5 miles round trip, is one of the park\u2019s longer trails.  It offers views of steep cliffs and pinnacles as you change vertical elevation 120 feet.  Park at Kneeling Camel Overlook and walk a few yards east to a spur road that leads to the old ranger station.  Follow the old service road.  After 3/4 of a mile the road comes to a stock pond.

The roar of the water \u2026 was constantly in our ears, and the walls of the canyon, towering half a mile in height above us, were seemingly vertical.  Occasionally a rock would fall from one side or the other, with a roar and crash, exploding like a ton of dynamite when it struck bottom, making us think our last day had come.\"\u2013 Abraham Lincoln Fellows, 1901, while floating the Black Canyon of the Gunnison on a rubber mattress \r\nThe Black Canyon of the Gunnison, at over 2700 feet in depth (deepest point), 1100 feet in width at the top (narrowest point) and 40 feet in width at the bottom (narrowest point), is one of the most awe-inspiring sites in the American West.  It is called \u201cblack\u201d because the steep, narrow walls allow very little sunlight to penetrate it.  Indeed, it is sometimes referred to simply as \"The Black\".  \r\n\r\nIt has been a mighty barrier to humans from time immemorial.\u00a0\r\nLunch on the precipice.  Even the Ute Indians, who have lived in the region since written history began, did not venture into its depths.  The first written record came from the Hayden Expedition of 1873-1874.  They deemed the Black Canyon inaccessible.  \r\n\r\nIn the early 1900s the residents of nearby Uncompahgre Valley needed the river\u2019s water.  Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence floated it and determined that an irrigation tunnel could be built.  The 5.8 mile Gunnison Diversion Tunnel was opened in 1909, and still delivers water to the valley today.  \r\n\r\nThe canyon is 48 miles long.  In 1999, congress designated 14 miles of the canyon as Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park.  In this 14-mile stretch, the river drops by an average of 95 feet per mile.  It drops 480 feet in a single two mile run.  This fast, debris-laden water is what is carving the canyon walls so steeply.\r\n\r\nThe park offers a number of rewarding activities for outdoor enthusiasts, including easy rim hiking trails, challenging backcountry hiking, bouldering, technical climbing, and Class IV/V paddling.  \r\n", "Red Tape": "Effective January 1, 2007, an entrance fee of $15.00 per vehicle is charged at the South Rim entrance station, or at the North Rim ranger station of Black Canyon.  It covers all persons in a single, private, noncommercial vehicle and is valid for seven calendar days. The entry fee for pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcycles, motor scooters, or mopeds is $7.00 per person, not to exceed $14.00 per vehicle. There is no fee charged for persons 16 years of age or younger.  Various passes are also accepted for entrance to the park. \r\n\r\nAll backcountry activities require a pass.

Image by Mountain Jim.\u00a0\r\nLayton Kor on the first ascent of Painted Arete.  Image by Mountain Jim.\r\nBlack Canyon of the Gunnison is known for its serious, traditional climbing values.  Climbers have pioneered 145 big-wall routes.  The main climbing walls are 1800 feet (550 meters) tall, and feature steep face climbing and cracks on often poor rock with difficult protection.  They have from 3 to 26 pitches.  They are rated from 5.8 to 5.13.  Over 100 routes are rated between 5.10 and 5.13.  Most climbs do not see significant climbing activity.  Some are aid routes.  All are committing, and many climbers say that the ratings at Black Canyon of the Gunnison can be deceiving.  The National Park Service retains copies of topos and route information that have been turned in by first ascent parties.  An ice climbing route, Gandalf\u2019s Beard, is located in Headquarters Draw.  Ask a ranger for current conditions.   \r\n\r\nAll climbers are to be prepared for self-rescue.  Rescues, when necessary, are highly technical.  Consider:  A rescued person cannot be lowered to a waiting ambulance at the bottom!  An overnight stay during a climb will not warrant a rescue; all climbers are to be prepared for an unexpected bivy.  There are some easier climbs available; a ranger\u2019s advice is recommended.  Climbers would be well-advised to obtain a copy of the book Black Canyon Rock Climbs by Robbie Williams.  It includes numerous photos, essays and routes.  \r\n\r\nMost climbers descend at the North Rim after marshaling at the North Rim Campground.  To help prevent multiple parties from piling up on a route, the North Rim visitor center has a white board for informal monitoring of who is climbing where.  In addition, to assist climbers who descend at the North Rim for a South Rim climb, a Tyrolean traverse static line has been set up between the North and South Rim Chasm View walls.  The alternative is a 2-3 hour drive, one way, between the two locations.  \r\n\r\nThe cliff walls are a designated wilderness area and thus require special procedures.  All climbers should be familiar with the guidance in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison Interim Climbing Managment Plan (.pdf).  A few highlights include:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Use removable protection to preserve the condition of the rock. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Motorized drills are prohibited.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Leave natural features undisturbed.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Avoid sensitive animal habitats.  Painted Wall climbs are usually closed March 15 through July 15 for the protection of nesting peregrine falcons.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o Wear a helmet:  The rock can be loose, and visitors along the rim have been known to throw rocks over it (despite being told not to!).  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 o When climbing routes with no bivouac expected, climbers will follow standard LNT practices for human waste.  When climbing routes where a bivuoac is expected, climbers will carry a container sufficient to contain human waste, and the container and contents will be removed from the park after the climb.\r\n\r\nAll backcountry access, including climbing, requires a free permit.

", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Geological History": "Two billion years ago, dark hues of gneiss and schist formed in the earth\u2019s crust.  As these dark rocks cracked beneath the surface, pink pegmatite squeeze into the fissures, creating patters that are clearly seen at Painted Wall in the canyon.  Sediments were deposited above the rocks for another 1.5 billion years.  In the Mesozoic era, color was added to the Precambrian rocks in the form of sand dunes turned to sandstone.  Later, an inland sea left behind mud, which became Mancos shale, seen in the adobes on the edge of Gunnison Gorge.  About 65 million years ago the Rocky Mountains were formed.  This forced up the black and pink Precambrian rocks and the red Mesozoic layers in the Gunnison Uplift.  From 18-30 million years ago volcanoes in West Elk and San Juan mountains spewed pewter-colored ash over the Gunnison Uplift, which trapped the water.  The water then began to cut through this rainbow of sedimentary rocks on its way to the Colorado River.  Today, dams upriver have slowed the rush of water through the canyon, thus reducing the rate of erosion to a fraction of its geological history.  ", "Location": "Colorado,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},
{"Activities": "Hiking,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Map": "\nBirch Hollow Map\n", "Overview": "\n            Birch Hollow is an excellent beginner slot canyon with incredible twisting rock formations offering unique scenery hidden in the depths of the Zion National Park area. Descending 1,400 feet from the trailhead, it takes you quickly down to the famous Orderville Canyon, where a number of return options exist. Although the canyon does not lie within the park, it's very close by, and you will feel the bustling nature of the scenic drive here, especially since this canyon is quite popular. This canyon is rated at 3A III with the only difficulties being some long rappels, however all the anchors are two bolt/chain anchors so very little anchor building knowledge is needed. You will often find guided parties, and large groups here so if you come expecting solitude, perhaps best to go on a weekday. Also, Birch Hollow does not have any water/potholes to deal with so cold water gear is also not needed. The longest rappel is the first big drop and is right at 35 meters, however with a 60 meter rope you can still descend the entire canyon if you take the bypass route heading around the first drop.\nFall foliage on Highway 9 near the east park boundary\n", "Created/Edited": "Dec26,2016/Dec26,2016", "Camping/Red Tape": "Since this is just outside of Zion National Park, there is no red tape. However if you plan to hike down Orderville Canyon, you will need a canyoneering permit. Dispersed car camping can be found along one of the many dirt roads leading off of the North Fork County Road in the vicinity of Birch Hollow.

This hike down Orderville would be a multiple day trip! If you don't have an extra car or mountain bike, there is an easy way to park at the main trailhead for Birch Hollow, and return to the same spot without a super long road walk. This will be the route I will describe, since you won't see any other information about it elsewhere.The main trailhead for Birch Hollow is located on the North Fork County Road, 8.5 miles north off State Highway 9. Get here from Zion by driving through the Mount Carmel Tunnel, and exit the east side of the park and drive another 1.8 miles east from the park boundary. Turn left (north onto the North Fork County Road and drive 8.5 miles on this good gravel road to the trailhead, passing the Zion Ponderosa Resort en-route. The trailhead is a small parking area right where the road crosses the Birch Hollow dry wash, which heads down to the west. A sign here confirms you are at the Birch Hollow Trailhead.\u00a0Begin hiking down the wash following a nice, but narrow trail. The wash is quite small and not very deep, and it's about a mile walk until you reach the first big drop, where you have two options. You can either rappel down from a tree right over the overhanging 35 meter drop (best to belay beginners since this rappel has an awkward start), or you can follow a faint trail leading left, up and over a small hill and steeply down through the trees to the left (west) side of the drop. This path is slick but not too difficult and ends in the wash below the rappel by a couple large logs. If you don't have a 70 meter rope, you will have to take this bypass route. The rest of the canyon is a very fun, rappel crazy adventure that I've described in the table below. There are a handful of other smaller drops that can either be rapelled or downclimbed by more experienced canyoneers ranging from 8-20 feet in length that are not listed below as well.RappelPhotoLengthDescription228mFrom the bottom of the first big drop, continue down the wash another 0.3 mile to the second big drop, and rappel from an excellent tree anchor down a smooth wall. Shortly after this rappel the canyon narrows, and deepens considerably.\n3-5VariesMake a series of short rappels (ranging from 10-25 feet) down the upper part of the slot canyon. This section is very scenic but not very deep yet.625mAfter a short 30 foot walk down the slot canyon, rappel off a tree just off to the left straight down a smooth chute to the now deep canyon floor. Enjoy the darkening and somewhat creepy slot canyon. From this point you will remain in a deep slot until the end.715mJust around the corner is a short rappel off a bolt anchor.\n815mAnother straight-forward rap off of two bolts on the right down another chute. Hike down canyon a bit and down-climb a little 8' tall boulder obstacle.\n911mThis one is off of two bolts on the right, and heads down another chute that usually has a bunch of of logs at the bottom. Right around the corner is the grand finale!\n10\n25mThis is probably the best rappel in the canyon. You drop straight down through a twisted chamber with excellent opportunities for some incredible photos. No easy way to describe this spot other than to say it's unlike anything I have ever seen (See photo to the left!)\n1118mA wonderful rappel down a double flute ends at the ground. Fifty feet away Birch Hollow meets with\u00a0Orderville Canyon.\nExit OptionsThere are a few ways to return to the roadside trailhead from where you began. If you were able to spot a car or bike at the Orderville Canyon Corral off to the east, simply turn right and hike up the wide open Orderville Canyon up to the corral (or the 4WD parking area only 30 minutes up if you spotted a truck there). For most people who don't have that luxury, there are two cross country hiking routes that will lead you back up to the North Fork County Road without having to hike all the way up Orderville Canyon, then back down along the road, which would likely take even the fastest of hikers 4-5 hours.Both these cross country routes involve some bushwhacking, but they are worth it since you will save many miles of boring walking. A GPS or at least a good map would be required since there are many small hills and gullies to navigate and can easily be confused as to which ridge you need to be on. The shorter of the two options (labeled Exit 2 in the map below), would be to hike up Orderville Canyon from where Birch Hollow meets it for a half mile. Here you will see Wild Wind Hollow coming in from the right (east). Hike up this wash for only 5-10 minutes then hike up the hill to the south aiming for the small ridge that divides Birch and Wild Wind Hollows, and follow this ridge back to the road. The final half mile or so the ridge is directly above the upper part of Birch Hollow you started hiking down.The second, slightly longer option (labeled Exit 1 in the map below), is to continue further up Orderville Canyon almost to the 4WD parking area and head up the next major ridge to the northeast of Wild Wind Canyon. You'll have to hike over a small hill along the way and suffer through a bit of steep bushwhacking in a couple spots, but overall the route is not bad. Near the top pass by some white colored rocks and scramble to the top where you'll meet a narrow road that leads to some old mines. This is where the best dispersed camping in the area is located. Walk this old road back to the North Fork Road and it's another 15 minutes down the road back to your car. Both of these return routes take about 1.5-2 hours from where you first meet Orderville Canyon, with the Exit 1 option being maybe 30 minutes longer.\nLooking back up Birch Hollow from its end\nHiking up Orderville Canyon\n\nViews from the cross country exit route\n\nOld buildings along the North Fork County RoadGear NeededThe required gear for this canyon is a 60 meter rope, harness and rappel device for each person, helmet, and food/water.

During Salt Lake's regular warm thaws throughout the winter, the lower routes often melt out enough to allow climbing in the middle of the winter!  During the winter there are also a number of mixed WI routes in the canyon, so climbing can be done year-round.\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Don't Forget to Check Out These Sister Pages!Little Cottonwood Canyon | Wasatch Alpine Climbs\r\nBig Cottonwood Canyon is one of the three large canyons that carves dramatically through the +11,000 ft high Wasatch Mountains, dropping some 3,000 ft to the Wasatch Front Metropolitain area. Collectively these three canyons are known as the tri-canyon areas (Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon, & Little Cottonwood Canyon), with the Cottonwood Canyons being popular for a multitude of activities such as cycling, hiking, snowshoeing, picnicking, backcountry skiing, fishing, mountaineering, and rock climbing. Brighton and Solitude ski resorts are also located at the top of the canyon and are accessible via public transit.\r\n\r\nDuring the mid-1800s, miners sought their fortune in gold and silver in this canyon, and remnants of the old mines can still be found in the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular vistas of the 15 mile long canyon are carved by the erosive powers of its rivers, leaving behind rugged and broken cliffs of smooth hard quartzite. While at first glance these cliffs don't appear to hold much climbing potential, they actually sport many good routes on solid rock ranging from 5.4-5.13d.  The quartzite is hard and slick, and the holds form at odd angles requiring unique body positions to use, but the angular holds abound for crimping and edging. Another aspect of climbing in Big Cottonwood Canyon is that the routes are often steeper than they look. \r\n\r\nBecause of the nature of the quartzite, many routes in the canyon are difficult to protect, the result being that some of the routes in the canyon require expertise with nutcraft. New routes have proliferated in the 80s and 90s with the improvement of power drills, and there are now many bolted routes in the canyon that once were unprotectable. In some cases, routes may have a mixture of trad climbing with a few bolts here and there for the runouts. Bolting of existing routes is highly discouraged by the local climbing community, but bolting of a new route, if done carefully and tastefully, can be acceptable. Most of the routes ascended before the 80s were done from the ground up, and only recently have the newer routes been bolted on rappel.\r\n\r\nIn general, Big Cottonwood Canyon sports many single-pitch climbs that can be top-roped, with a good number of the routes' anchors being accessible with out an initial lead climb.  Because of this, it is a good canyon for beginning climbers or those who want to practice harder routes. There are also a number of short multi-pitch routes ranging from 2 to 4 pitches.  A big draw for climbing in this canyon is the abundance of shady crags, and climbers at Dogwood crag and the Storm Mountain Area can end the day with a picnic at the neighboring picnic areas.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many possible routes in the canyon, most of the routes listed in guidebooks are within a 15 minute hike from the road. Due to the laziness of local craggers, there are many unrecorded and unclimbed routes on the cliffs higher up the steep canyon walls.\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=40.61940&amp;distance_lon_9=-111.78740&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.61940\u00b0N/111.7874\u00b0W</a>", "Nearby Amenities": "Emergency Services\r\nDiall 911 from any  phone.

Next is the epicenter of climbing in Big Cottonwood Canyon, a huge number of walls and aretes surrounding the Storm Mountain Picnic area and reaching up into Mule Hollow and Tanners Gulch. Above this there is more climbing to had in some gulleys and buttresses on the north side of the canyon until you reach the highest point with much climbing potential in the canyon - the S-Curve. There are a number of climbing areas here, as well as Millstone Slab and alpine routes on Sundial Peak up Mill B South Fork, and some remote but high quality climbing areas far up Mill B North Fork.\r\n\r\nThe climbing areas are described in the order in which they are reached, heading up the canyon. Only areas listed under the route section are covered here - there are many more yet to climb!\r\n\r\nDogwood Crag:\r\nThis climbing area features many single pitch climbs on a wall rising out of (or nearly out of) Big Cottonwood Canyon Stream. It is 0.95 miles up the canyon and is next to a picnic area, which can be nice for having a mid-climb or post-climb picnic.\r\n\r\nJHCOB Wall:\r\nThe next five areas are within a short distance of each other (2.25 mi-2.7 mi) and you can really walk from one to the other. JHCOB Wall (sometimes called Jacob Wall) is a giant wall/arete that towers some 300 ft above the Big Cottonwood Canyon road. It offers many nice multipitch trad routes. The acronym stands for: Jesus H. Christ on a Bicycle.\r\n\r\nSalt Lake Slips:\r\nLocated across the river just up the road from JHCOB Wall. A fun tyrolean traverse is needed to cross the river, especially in the spring. This area has a number of sport climbs on a shaded wall.\r\n\r\nNarcolepsy Area:\r\nThis shady crag is the next one up the canyon from JHCOB wall on the south side of the road. It features a number of crack climbs and some good steep sport routes, all of which can be top-roped. A somewhat 'lengthy' approach keeps this climbing area a little more empty than the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nStorm Mountain Island:\r\nThis area is accessed via Storm Mountain Picnic Ground. It has a variety of routes, ranging from easy routes to desperate overhangs.

It\u2019s characterized by spectacular scenery along the Yellowstone River, with interesting geology at the upstream sections.\r\n\u00a0Running Buck\r\nLike most of Yellowstone NP, the Black Canyon is good wildlife territory.  In the fall I saw a lot of pronghorn on the Rescue Creek Trail, and some bighorns on the lower slopes of Mount Everts.  We also saw deer near Blacktail Deer Creek, appropriately enough, and I\u2019ve seen evidence of wolves on the south side of the Yellowstone River in various places.  Elk and bison use various stretches of the canyon as a travel corridor in spring and fall.  This means there will be winter kill in the spring that attracts bears, so be bear-aware.  In addition, this is the only part of the park low enough for rattlesnakes, and I\u2019ve also seen gopher snakes and many garter snakes. \r\n\u00a0Monument Plant\r\nIn my June trips, I\u2019ve found that its approach trails from the south all have good wildflowers, as does the narrowest part of the Canyon.  The hike out to Gardiner is too exposed for most species, but you\u2019ll see cacti that may or may not be in bloom.  Many stretches have lots of grass that ticks love in June.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause it\u2019s in the part of the park with the lowest elevations, the Black Canyon is free of snow longer than anywhere else in the park.  This makes it one of the first places to melt out in the spring and summer, so it's good for early season trips.  The Canyon also has treeless stretches that are exposed to the hot summer sun, such as the descent to Hellroaring bridge, Rattlesnake Butte to Rescue Creek trailhead, and the south-facing, burnt-brown last few miles above Gardiner.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Bouldering,Scrambling", "Geographic Context": "Calf Creek Canyon is located in the northeastern section of the Grand Staircase-National Monument.  The Monument is located near the center of the Colorado Plateau, a broad, roughly oval shaped area in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.  Situated in southern Utah, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument encompasses some of the most distinctive geography of the Colorado Plateau, an area known for distinctive geography.  \r\n\r\nGeography of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument\r\n\r\n\u00a0The Grand Staircase: the Pink, White and Vermilion Cliffs\r\n\r\nThe Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument can be divided into three distinctive regions.  In the west is the Grand Staircase itself.  Four parallel rows of cliffs, the Pink, Gray, White, and Vermilion Cliffs are so named because of the color of the rock they are composed of.  The stone layers exposed in these cliffs extend eastward, through other parts of the Monument.  The colorful formations of Bryce Canyon National Park are carved out of the Pink Cliffs, while the sandstone canyons of Zion National Park are carved out of the layers of the White Cliffs.  The Vermilion Cliffs rise above the route to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  This area contains the large Paria-Hackberry Wilderness Study Area.  Canyons carved into the White Cliffs are found within.  \r\n\r\nThe central portion of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a broad highland called the Kaiparowits Plateau.  This broad area contains numerous hills and ridges as it tapers off to the south.  Its eastern edge is bordered by the Straight Cliffs, a roughly fifty mile long escarpment.  Numerous Wilderness Study Areas are found on the Kaiparowits Plateau.  \r\n\r\n\u00a0Canyons of the Escalante\r\n\r\nThe Canyons of the Escalante River and its tributaries dominate the eastern section of the Monument.  Calf Creek Canyon is found in this region.  The Escalante River is named after Father Silvestre V\u00e9lez de Escalante, the Spanish Franciscan missionary who explored the region in 1776.  The Canyons of the Escalante are not limited to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.  Many of them, especially the Escalante River itself also flow into Glen Canyon National Recreation Area.  \r\n\r\nPhipps-Death Hollow Instant Study Area\r\n\r\nAlthough the part of Calf Creek Canyon north of the campground is in the Calf Creek Recreation Area, the majority is located along the eastern boundary of the Phipps-Death Hollow Instant Study Area.  The ISA is adjacent to the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness found in Dixie National Forest.  This begins around 9,000 ft. and drops of precipitously, leaving fantastic sandstone canyons.  Pine, Death Hollow, Sand and Calf Creeks are the main drainages off of the high elevation plateau.  The Boulder Mail Trail traverses the Phipps-Death Hollow ISA.  The 16.2 mile trail was once the mail route used to being letters from Escalante to Boulder.  \r\n", "Getting There": "\u00a0Lower Calf Creek Falls\r\n\r\nUpper canyon and Upper Calf Creek Falls:\r\n\r\nFrom Boulder, proceed south on Highway 12.

Tall Navajo sandstone cliffs, strange rock formations, lush riparian vegetation, Indian ruins, and a perennial stream with two gorgeous waterfalls are what one can expect from Calf Creek Canyon.  Proximity to Utah Highway 12 and the ease of the hike to Lower Calf Creek Falls make this canyon a great introduction to the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.\u00a0Lower Calf Creek Falls\u00a0Calf Creek Canyon\r\n\r\nThe highlight of the canyon is its two fantastic waterfalls.  Upper Calf Creek Falls is a slender 88 ft. waterfall with an emerald pool and a lush, wide canyon.  Few people spend much time at this falls, although there is ample opportunity for exploring the canyon in isolation.  The Upper Falls\u2019 obscurity is due in large measure to its sibling downstream. Lower Calf Creek Falls is the real star of Calf Creek Canyon.  Falling 126 ft, Lower Calf Creek Falls is perhaps the most elegant waterfall in the southwest.  Falling a few feet over the initial precipice it then ricochets outward before falling onto the sloping sandstone below, where it cascades the rest of its way into the beautiful pool below.  The entire display is very colorful.  The whitewater contrasts sharply against the reddish sandstone and the green algae that has taken hold on the cliff walls.  The pools beneath both falls are great for a quick dip.  There is an additional pool adjacent to the one beneath Upper Calf Creek Falls.\r\n\r\nThe human presence in the canyon dates back to prehistoric times.  There are a few small ruins hidden amidst notches in the cliffs below the Lower Falls.  Following the arrival of American settlers, the canyon was used as a corral for cattle.  The canyon\u2019s name dates from this period.  For many years Calf Creek Canyon was an unknown oasis in the midst of southern Utah\u2019s sandstone country.  In 1996 the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was established.  Since that time visitation has continued to increase.  Nonetheless, people are still relatively few given the isolated location.  Solitude is still easily acquired, especially as one ventures away from the Lower Falls.  \r\n\r\nThe trail to the Upper Falls is very short and drops 600 ft. to the canyon bottom.  From there, once can scramble downstream, despite the lake of an established trail.  It is also possible to travel cross-country to the top of the falls or even to the west side of the canyon.  The trip to the Lower Falls is a sandy 2.75 miles that dead-ends at the base of the falls.

Cut by the Blackwater River, the gorge averages well over 500 feet deep and it remains a relatively pristine area filled with a vast forest of hemlocks, pines, poplars, and oaks.\r\n\r\nA bit over 2,000 acres of the canyon is preserved as Blackwater Falls State Park, one of West Virginia\u2019s premiere parks. There are a number of canyon rim trails, a ski slope within the park, a lodge, cabins, and a campground. For sheer physical beauty, this is one of the most impressive parks in the Southeastern United States.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Northward.\r\n\r\nThere are a quite a few spectacular waterfalls here, most notably Blackwater Falls, a 57-foot drop that displays the dark water for which the river and canyon (and falls) are named. The water is darkened not from soil runoff, but from the tannins created by the mildly acidic effects of the many hemlocks trees that clothe the canyon\u2019s slopes. While the hemlock wooly adelgid that has decimated the forests farther east have recently been reported in the park, they have so far not destroyed these trees. However, unless there is a wide-scale application of the insecticide imadacloprid, these forests will fall to extinction as have those from Virginia south to Georgia.\r\n\r\nNo official trails find their ways to the canyon floor, and travel into \u00a0Overlook.the canyon itself is not encouraged. However, there are a number of unofficial trails and manways that weave down from the canyon rim and to the floor of the gorge. The best of these descends from Pendleton Overlook and is relatively easy to follow, if not so easy to negotiate. Some scramblers periodically leave nylon ribbons along this manway to keep hikers from straying too far into the maze of rhododendron hells. Use of these manways, while not encouraged, is not prohibited. Just use common sense when climbing down the extremely steep slopes into the rugged canyon floor.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, the canyon has been at the center of a drive to protect the lands that are not currently within the boundaries of the Blackwater Falls State Park. Efforts to preserve several thousand a\u00a0Lindy Point.dditional acres failed when the landowner sold the property to a timber company which desperately wants to log the canyon of its timber and leave the place devastated and unsuitable for a park. Additionally, this company is even lobbying to be able to move the timber from their logging operations through the existing park. Only time will tell if conservationists will prevail in creating a new National Park in this place, or if yet another corporation will succeed in raping the land for short-term profits.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of rare and endangered species that live within the Blackwater Canyon, and hopefully the presence of these living things will aid in stopping any further logging operations by the Allegheny Wood Products company.

See the Point 4706 Route Page for details.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to enter the canyon system via the upper end and from the Sunset Pass road.      There appears to be no major obstacles.\r\n\r\nYet another option to access this canyon is from the Red Benches and Fiddler Cove Canyon.    This route will take several days, but requires less driving on rough roads.\r\n\r\nTwo days should enough to explore the entire canyon from the Point 4706 or the Sunset Pass Trailheads, but if you want to explore Fiddler Cove Canyon as well, three days is recommended.    Three days is recommended if coming in from any other route adn four is recommended to explore both canyons from these longer routes.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark and six year old Matthew climbing the steep class 3 section of the exit route from Hatch Canyon on the Point 4706 Route.\r\n", "Activities": "Hiking,TradClimbing,Toprope,Bouldering,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "There are several driving routes that can be used to access the Hatch Canyon system.

{"Routes Overview": "There are many, many forks and routes available.    Below is a quick summary of each fork.    See the route pages for more details.    (Several route pages will be added but are under construction.    All the below routes will have route pages in the near future).\r\n\r\nThese are the major forks of Bluejohn Canyon. This map is for identification purposes and not to be used for navigation. Google Earth image.\r\n\r\nHere is an outline of the various routes. \r\n\r\nMain Fork Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis fork has a long narrows section including one walk through corridor section.      By a competent rock climber, can be done without ropes in both directions, up and down, but all parties should bring a 100 or more foot climbing rope anyway and just in case, regardless of climbing experience.    Climbing out is rated 5.7 or 5.8 on the YDS, but isn\u2019t very exposed.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the Main Fork from the top you can exit either the West Fork Bluejohn, the West E/E (entry/exit) Route, or continue all the way down through Lower Bluejohn Canyon to Horseshoe Canyon.     \r\n\r\nClimbing out the Main Fork Bluejohn.\r\n\r\nLittle Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis fork has a short narrows and enters Main Fork Bluejohn Canyon just below the Corridor Narrows.     Exit options include going down canyon and using the West E/E Route, or climbing all the way out the Main Fork.      You can also continue all the way down canyon through Lower Bluejohn.\r\n\r\nWest E/E Route\r\n\r\nThis is a cross country route of only class 2 in difficulty, but a route that required routefinding.    The route can be used to enter or exit the Main Fork Bluejohn Canyon.   If you want to see some of the good parts of Bluejohn without any technical difficulty, this is your route. \r\n\r\nWest E/E Route to Bluejohn Canyon.\r\n\r\nWest Fork Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis fork can be used to enter or exit the Bluejohn complex.     The route is around 5.5 or 5.6, but there is a bypass around this section that is supposed to be only 3rd class.     The canyon has a short section of narrows.      The West Fork may be the best route to access Lower Bluejohn to Horseshoe Canyon since coming down the Main or East Forks makes for a very long day.      It is also commonly used as an exit route after completing the Main Fork from the bottom down.   \r\n\r\nLittle East Fork Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis fork is mostly uninteresting so won\u2019t be detailed here.    It is the largest east-side side drainage of the East Fork.\r\n\r\nEast Fork Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThe East Fork is yet another interesting Fork of Bluejohn and also the longest fork as well.     It has some long interesting narrows and some technical challenges.      It requires a 100 foot or longer rope.    After completing the East Fork from the top you can exit either the West Fork Bluejohn, the West E/E (entry/exit) Route, or continue all the way down through Lower Bluejohn Canyon to Horseshoe Canyon.      Competent rock climbers can exit via the Main Fork and this has become a popular loop.\r\n\r\nSqueeze Fork (a.k.a. Dark Slot) Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best sections of the Bluejohn system.      It is a short fork, but involves some spicy downclimbs and some dark narrows.      Competent rock climbers can climb up or down this slot.      A 100 foot or longer rope is recommended.    Exit options are the same for the East Fork or you can go up the East Fork as well.\r\n\r\nLower Bluejohn\r\n\r\nThis is the section of the canyon that has become notorious because of the accident with Aron Ralston and is where he amputated his arm.    This is one of the best sections (perhaps the best) of Bluejohn Canyon, but the narrows are fairly short.     They are very convoluted and quite scenic and the canyon can be very dark at times.       This section of the complex (lower Bluejohn) is accessed through any of the routes above.\r\n\r\nThis is the least popular section of Bluejohn because it involves a long hike out though Horseshoe Canyon.     Alternately, any competent rock climber can re-ascend the slot after reaching the big drop.      Completing the route through Bluejohn and Horseshoe Canyon requires at least a 50 meter rope.\r\n\r\nIn Horseshoe Canyon, there are several pictograph panels said to be dated to 3000-8000 years old.

John Griffith had one brown eye and one blue eye that earned him his nickname Blue John.        In the late 1800\u2019s, alone he launched a boat on the Colorado River from Hite and attempted to float through Glen Canyon to Lees Ferry.    He disappeared and no trace of him was ever found.   \r\n\r\nThe canyon became world famous after Aron Ralston had his epic descent of the canyon.    In 2003, he was forced to amputate his own arm in order to escape and survive.\r\n\r\nAfter some earier exploration, we made our first trip (the ancient cultures probably found a way through a long time ago and were probably the first visitors-pictographs in well known Horseshoe Canyon [non-technical] below Bluejohn date back 3000-8000 years ago) of the entire canyon (head to mouth) when I led a trip in the mid 1990\u2019s. We found it to be a great canyon.  \r\n\r\nI also told a famous guidebook author of the canyon, but asked that it not be published. Even so, I guess my reuest when unheeded because I was surprised when it actually showed up at the top of the best adventures ever in a book that published a few years later (which was the same book that Aaron Ralston was using on his now infamous trip).     Thus it become popular, but not famous, that is until the \u201cRalston incident\u201d.\r\n\r\nBecause Bluejohn Canyon has showed up in this and now two other guidebooks, and several websites, plus in countless media reports after Aaron\u2019s epic descent, the place has become world famous. What before saw almost no visitors, now sees at least 100 or possibly several more visitors a year and has become one of the most popular and famous slot canyons in Utah.    After some of the ones in Zion National Park, this may be the most popular technical slot canyon in Utah.\r\n\r\nWhile the canyon requires technical rock and canyoneering skills to negotiate, non-technical hikers can access some of the best parts of the canyon.

I know others that have experienced the same sensation. I found myself one day hesitantly walking up to the desk with Oak Creek in the background at the visitors center. I then asked the ranger on duty if I may peer at the 3 ring binders that were stashed away for those and only those that knew of them. Somewhat intimidated, I flipped one of them open and landed on an account of \"Heaps Canyon\" by Royce Trapier. I had not heard of this canyon so I had to see what and where it might be. After seeing that it was a fairly gentle approach (up the West Rim) my interest peaked. \r\n\r\nReading further was just like adding wood to my fire. The descriptions were vivid accounts of many awkward rappels into frigid pools of water, scrambles across impossibly angled slabs of rock, climbs up log jams that required every ounce of energy that could be mustered, but what really stopped me for a second and third and fourth careful study was something he described as the \"Devils Pit\". I believe the year was 1992?\r\n\r\nMy First Attempt\r\n\r\nI rounded up a couple friends that I had hiked Mystery Canyon and a couple other classics with, (Mystery was not a classic back then) and gave them my spiel! Carefully I assured them that this hike would be an adventure not soon forgotten. I didn't describe the hardships experienced by Royce Trapier in an attempt he had made previous to his successful Heaps bid. I didn't want to lose any chance I may have to recruit partners for this spellbinding hike. After placing a rope at Upper Emerald Pool and leaving a vehicle at the Lodge, we made our way to the trailhead at Lava Point. The hike was easy but hot on that June Day and by 1PM we had arrived at a point that may or may not be the entry into Heaps. We had sucked down all of our water carried and I volunteered to run over to Cabin Springs to pump our bottles full of another dose of the clear elixir. When I had returned to the head of the canyon we were about to venture into, I realized that both of the partners I had so slyly recruited for this adventure were very dehydrated. I knew that the attempt was in jeopardy, so we took a vote and decided that it wasn't to be. Behunin was just down the trail and we didn't want to have hauled all that gear and not use it. It was a fun hike thru Behunin Canyon that day!\r\n\r\nAnother Recruiting Attempt\r\n\r\nMy thirst was just temporarily quenched. The next year I was able to get two other friends convinced. Mike was a skating buddy (played roller hockey together) and Mark was the owner of the roller rink that we played at. I had hiked Mystery with Mike but Mark hadn't had the opportunity to even rappel yet. I took Mark out to a local Crag 2 days before our slated Saturday morning departure, and showed him the delicate intricacies of descending a rope. He did well and had fun. The night before the trip I went to the rink and met with the two, and explained that this would be a very difficult hike, probably the most difficult any of us may have ever experienced. I offered the chance to end it here and now (in a way I was hoping they would resign!), but they both said they would be ready at 4AM. \r\n\r\nSecond Time is a Charm\r\nDay One\r\nOnce again we drove up to the Lodge and I ran up and stashed the requisite 300' x 8mm accessory cord that would enable us to finish the hike with all of our gear. We started up the West Rim this time from the bottom. By 1PM and slogging in the heat of the day, we arrived at the spot that made sense for the descent. Down we go and after about an hour of hunting, and pecking we found ourselves at a tree with webbing. This is the start. Once we go down and pull our ropes we will be committed (probably to an institution!).  Our packs were laden with lots of gear. I did not want to fail! My pack dry weighed 65# and Mark and Mike carried a bit less, but then it was my idea so I had the honors! We had 1100' of various size and length rope, the questionable by today's standard full bolt kit with hooks, a set of cams and nuts, my climbing shoes, overnight gear, food and water and FULL, THICK WETSUITS rented from the local Dive shop. I didn't want to fail this attempt! We made the rappels with only having the rope jam twice, re-ascending and then onward again. As we looked thru the ever deepening almost limestone textured rock, peering south toward \"The Crossroads\", I mentioned that it was a lot like a \"Gunsight\". I think the name stuck? We arrived at the Slab of rock that I remembered in the description. Carefully walk down and then place hands on the east side and feet on west side and do a full body stem for the next 100 yards (Its easier to rappel this section). Holy Heck! You talk about a workout! On to the next obstacles; a few rappels some short some long, a couple swims, some short some long and Voila! 8PM and we are just above the Crossroads....I think? We are beat...lets settle in above the wash and cook some MRE's (Yummy) and get some sleep for the Heaps Narrows in the morning!\r\n\r\nDay Two\r\n\r\nIt took a while to get packed and going, but by 8AM we were on the trail! I remember that at the Crossroads we need to ascend a very steep ramp and then traverse 100 Yds. to a tree and then rappel 80' into the \"Alley\". A tough start to the morning! (now I know that its easier to just drop into the pool and walk around the corner!) Well...its 9:30 and we are here! Man does this canyon slot down in a hurry! On with the wetsuits and batten down the hatches and DIVE! Absolutely Stunning, unique, amazing and bitterly cold and wet! One pothole to the next pothole to the next logjam to the next rappel...to the next downclimb........on and on and on! It was unbelievable! Where is the \"Devils Pit\" I wondered? To a pothole, and its tougher to get out. Need some shoving from behind. That reminds me! Mark, let me have the bolt kit with the hooks since I'm leading.....\"What Bolt Kit?\" Mark exclaims! \"It fell out in one of those swims and I wasn't about to go diving!\" Mark!..I sure hope to \"Heck\" we don't need it in here! Onward! I kept saying, this must be the Devils Pit! Geez! There are a bunch of Devils Pits! We came to a place that appeared to fit Royces description best. This was it! Exit by scrambling up the 25' high logjam and down the backside...too easy? On the other side of the jam a single log stretched across a deep pothole for 20'. Now this looked super balancy and exciting! Put a rope around my waist in case I fall and you can drag my butt out of there! Now your turn! Now to another pothole but this time, no log; feet on one side and back on other and inch across. We made it...... downstream just a short distance, and I holler out, \"Its a 20 foot drop and no anchors!\"..wheres the bolt kit when you think you need it? Could rig an anchor back off the logjam if needed, but one more glance, ahhhhh, there's an old bolt hidden in a small alcove on the right!\r\n \r\nNearing the End of the Canyon\r\n\r\nThe canyon is widening out now. A couple long rappels and now at the end alas! Now where? I sort of remember that we have some very long drops ahead but I forget where we should go? Drop into the huge chimney overlooking Upper Emerald Pool? Nah! Too much work if its not the anchors. So I head up on the ledge on the east side of the chimney. Nothing, so it must be on the west side? I could jump across? Nope...too long to fall if I miss! so back down and after a short scramble up a dirty corner and a bit of romping, I peak my head over and shout...grab this end of the rope and tie the packs on. Heave-ho and up the packs come one at a time. Down to the anchor on a small pine tree and a short 50'er to a big pine tree and some GRAND EXPOSURE! Are those people down there? Yep! Next rap to the slanting ramp at the chimney. Three of us were snug as a bug in a rug! Pull out the 300'x8mm accessory cord that had been stashed in the \"wet\" drybag and over I go! Dig around in the grass for a bit, tie the stashes cord to the end and \"Haul Away!\". Mark comes first after careful inspection by Mike (Mark was now on about his 15th Rappel ever in his life) Down comes Mark with a little pressure from my conditional belay. Next up...Mike on his way! A little more assistance and at 9PM we're down! A couple handshakes and forced smiles and a few night see'rs applaud and what do you know, there's some wives and friends to lend a hand with the final jaunt to the vehicles and a promise of some \"cold pizza and cold beer\".

Only 12 persons are permitted per day to descend this wonderful slot canyon, but in reality far less people take advantage of the total daily permits available. Part of the reason lies in the difficulty of the canyon, and also in the equipment needs, but mostly in the experience level required to descend this strenuous canyon. ACA Rated 4CIV/V means that it is a canyon that demands serious skills and equipment beyond the realms of the average hiker.\r\n\r\nACA Ratings  \r\n\r\nI have had the opportunity to descend Heaps almost a dozen times, and one thing remains constant, a changing canyon. Whether by erosion, rockfall, log-jams or the amount of water present, Heaps has had a very different character on each of my trips. I have spent as many as 3 days, and as few as 9 hours on my trips through, but would suggest the first time you may plan a trip to expect a minimum of 16 hours and be prepared for an emergency bivouac. I use a wetsuit, but a drysuit is certainly lighter and more compact. I carry 1-300' rope, 2-150' ropes, 1-100' rope, extra webbing and screwlinks, emergency ascension, food and water, and emergency supplies.\r\n\r\nPothole escapes are not uncommon, long swims are a surety, upclimbs and downclimbs on wet slippery sandstone are frequent, and awkward rappels one after the other are found in Heaps Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe best season to hike Heaps is in the late spring when the pools are fullest and days are longest, however it can be done in the summer (be wary of monsoon rains and flash flooding), or in the fall (days are shorter).\r\n\r\nI suggest a 4-5AM start so be sure to get a permit prior to intended hike. A Red Tag Permit will allow you to drive your vehicle into the main canyon and park at the Grotto.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},
{"Activities": "Hiking", "Getting There": " Hilltop - VladislavThere are two ways into the Havasu Canyon.  The first is from the roadhead/giant parking lot at the Hualapai Hilltop, which is reached via a 50 mile drive from Highway 66, near the town of Peach Springs.    The ample signage on Highway 66 and Interstate 40 pointing the driver to Supai makes it difficult to get lost.  \r\n\r\nFrom the Hualapai Hilltop (elevation 4848'), one has the choice of helicopter, horse, or walking in to the town of Supai.  Supplies to the village are transported by mule and less frequently by helicopter.   If hiking, bring ample water as there is no reliable supply at the Hilltop. \r\n\r\nFrom the Hilltop hike down the trail into the Hualapai Canyon, a dry canyon except in times of flash flood.  Forget about taking the trip if flash floods threaten.  Hike straight down the canyon for several miles, eventually following the trail into Havasu Creek, the barren red desert replaced by a flowing stream and overwhelming greenery.  \r\n\r\nA short time later, a small bridge is crossed and the trail empties into the village of Supai.  For the tourist, there are a few little stores, a cafe, and a small motel.  My advice would be to camp instead.   The cottonwood-shaded campground is located 1 1/2 miles downstream of the village, right below the exquisite Havasu Falls.  \r\n\r\nThe second, and more ambitious way of getting to Havasu Canyon is via a rafting trip down the Grand Canyon.  Havasu Canyon is a common side canyon hike for rafters, kayakers, and other watercraft.  I ran into a few dories and rafts on my hike down to the Colorado River.   The 3-mile hike to Beaver Falls from the river is well worth the trip, as this is where Havasu Canyon is at its wildest and narrowest, with towering walls of orange/red rock in every direction. ", "Camping": "Havasu Creek at the Campground - by lisaeThe campground is located 1 1/2 miles downstream from the village.  Campground sites along the river stretch from just below Havasu Falls down to Mooney Falls.   Campground fees, assessed on a per person basis, are pretty steep but worth it.  \r\n\r\nRemember to check out Navajo Falls along the way.  ", "Overview": "\n            NOTE:  A Havasupai route page has been created and was originally attached to the Grand Canyon page but was recently detached.  My wish was to classify this as a canyon - which it is - and make the information more available to members and complement the existing route page. Check out the route page for more details, as I have no desire to reinvent the wheel.\r\nHavasu Falls by CornvallisTucked away in a remote corner of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is the land of the blue green water - the ancestral land of the Havasu'Baaja (Havasupai), a small tribe that has succeeded in maintaining its own language, culture, and distinctive genetic identity, despite long odds and numerous challenges.  \r\n\r\nUPDATE:  A summer thunderstorm in 2008 sent a wall of water down the canyon, destroying much of the trail.  The reservation is closed to visitors until at least spring 2009.\r\n\r\nThe tribe lives primarily in the village of Supai, located on a trail about 8 miles from the road's end.  Those interested in the rich and interesting history of the Havasupai should read \"I Am The Grand Canyon: The Story of the Havasupai People\" by Steven Hirst.  Reading this book ahead of time will make the trip to Supai more enjoyable.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHavasu Canyon is a very popular destination for the hiker - everyone should visit this magical place at least once.  The many tourists are primarily drawn to the waterfalls - Navajo, Havasu, and Mooney.  The beauty of the canyon is astonishing.  Beaver Falls is just as spectacular as the other three but only a small percentage of visitors to the reservation make it that far.\r\n\r\nThe spring fed waters of Havasu Creek originate in the Arizona's loftiest mountains, the San Franscisco Peaks.  The blue/green color of the waters of Havasu Creek are present as a result of high mineral content, including but not limited to calcium carbonate.  The calcium carbonate precipitates out of the water over time and creates lovely travertine \"terraces\", which \r\ncreate amazingly beautiful blue pools and innumerable smaller little mini-waterfalls.\r\n\r\nHavasu Canyon is not entirely within the jurisdiction of the tribe.  The final 3 or so miles of the canyon below Beaver Falls is managed by the National Park Service.   Just above the village of Supai, upstream of Havasu Creek, is Cataract Canyon, closed to all but the Havasupai.  What fun exploration that would be.\r\n\r\nThere was a well-publicized homicide of a Japanese tourist in 2006 within the bounds of the Havasu Canyon, but this appears to be an isolated incident.   Some of you may have read an article in \"Backpacker\" about the murder, for which a member of the tribe has been convicted.  Having read the article and taken a 4 day, 3-night trip to Havasu Canyon (along with a zillion other people), I think that the author loaded up the melodrama to make good copy.  \r\n\r\nThe murders of three people by Cary Stayner near Yosemite National Park several years ago hasn't kept the millions away from Yosemite Valley.\r\nDon't let it stop you from seeing one of the Earth's most magnificently beautiful places! The members of the tribe rely on tourism to make a living and staying home doesn't make their lives better.  \r\n\r\nSupai does have its problems but many thousands of people makes the trip and have great fun each year.  In my opinion, a greater threat to one's health on a trip to Havasupai is dehydration - drink and bring lots of water and avoid hiking during the heat of the day where possible.  Summer hiking in the Grand Canyon can be dangerous, and shade is often non-existent precisely at the moment you need it most, so take care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ", "Created/Edited": "Jan17,2008/Oct27,2008", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=36.23700&amp;distance_lon_9=-113.91000&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">36.23700\u00b0N/113.91\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall", "Red Tape": "Mooney Falls - Zac FinleyThe hotel in the village is reserved many months in advance.

Known by few, even among residents of New Mexico, the Canadian River Canyon is a region of soaring cliffs, diverse flora and fauna, wild rivers, striking rock formations and historic ruins.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian River is the largest tributary of the Arkansas River.  It flows 760 miles from southern Colorado to its confluence with the Arkansas in eastern Oklahoma.  Its headwaters are in Las Animas County, Colorado, where it flows off the eastern flanks of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains.  South of Springer, New Mexico, it carves a deep gorge through the Caprock, the same formation in which the Palo Duro Canyon and the Llano Estacado in Texas are located.  The Canyon itself stretches for miles south to Sabinoso, New Mexico, where the cliffs of the Canadian Escarpment finally drop away and the river enters the eastern New Mexico plains.  \r\n\r\nThis region is geologically akin to the Caprock or the Caprock Canyonlands of the Llano Estacado in west Texas and eastern New Mexico.  The name is derived from the stone layer that lies just beneath the Llano\u2019s sediment.  The caprock is exposed dramatically on the rim, where the stone is exposed and the strata observable.  The same phenomenon can be observed in the Canadian River Canyon.  The interior of the canyon and the canyons of the Caprock have a strong resemblance to many regions in the Colorado Plateau.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Sandstone cliffs in the Canadian River Canyon                       \r\nThe Canyon once hosted Kiowa and Comanche tribes who were later followed by homesteaders.  A resort was once established at the bottom of the canyon, which now lies in ruins.  Now few people enter the canyon, mostly hunters during deer season.  Nonetheless, opportunities for hiking, backpacking and bouldering abound. \r\n\r\nThe possibilities for hiking and backpacking are particularly enticing.  It is possible to follow the Canadian River for almost twenty miles.  The only thing that would prevent a fantastic trip through this region is the necessity of fording the river.  Early in the season this can be difficult when the Canadian is swollen with snow melt.  The rest of the year it is normally possible to cross.  There are some rocky, shallow area where it is easier to cross.  Numerous tributary canyons also provide several hiking opportunities.  The vegetation in the side canyons is generally thicker, with pinon pine, juniper, and ponderosa pine providing cover.  There are also numerous hiking and backpacking possibilities on the canyon rim.  \r\n\r\nClimbing may be possible on the sandstone cliffs, but this is untried so can not be confirmed here.  Another interesting possibility in the canyon is rafting.  It is rafted occasionally, but is generally overshadowed by the Rio Grande and Rio Chama to the west.

While many of the Black Hills' canyons are difficult to access, due to lack of roads or for private property concerns, Hell Canyon offers visitors a chance to explore much of it's basin.\r\n\r\nJewel Cave National Monument is probably the major reason why Hell Canyon is more accessible than most other Black Hills canyons.  While Jewel Cave National Monument is located almost entirely in the Hell Canyon basin, it only currently occupies about 2 square miles of the almost 82 square miles in the Hell Canyon basin.  As one of the world\u2019s longest cave systems, with over 170 miles mapped so far, cave experts believe this cave has the potential to become the world\u2019s largest someday .  But Jewel Cave was not always such a major factor in this area years ago.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Hell Canyon TowerRanchers settled this region in the late 1800\u2019s, following the first influx of gold-seekers to the Black Hills.  In addition to ranching, the mining and the timber industries did reasonably well.  In fact, timber was an important consideration when the Signal Hill fire lookout tower was built several miles north of Jewel Cave.  Both scientific and tourism interests led to the establishment of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in Hell Canyon in 1935.  For four years, workmen did much of the work that provided the foundation for what is now Jewel Cave National Monument. \r\n\r\nHell Canyon\u2019s basin actually starts in the extreme southern part of Pennington County at nearly 7,000 feet, just west of Bear Mountain.  The Hell Canyon watershed drains into Pass Creek, 3,000 feet lower, in southern Custer County.  Hell Canyon is joined by West Hell Canyon less than a mile north of Highway 16.  At the south end of Jewel Cave National Monument, Hell Canyon is joined by Lithograph Canyon.  The Gillette Canyon watershed lies to the north of Hell Canyon, while Tee Pee Canyon and Schenk Canyon are to the west of Hell Canyon.  \r\n\r\nThis rugged canyon system is characterized by sedimentary outcroppings of sandstone, dolomite, gypsum, some shale and limestone \u2013 both Pahasappa and Englewood.  There is no consistent water flow in the various streams in the canyon and its branches.  However, there are some springs.  Few produce much water, though there is one that creates a nice brook in West Hell Canyon.  However, that water all disappears underground again.  There is a big fault north of Jewel Cave, and some geologists believe that fault has something to do with the weak springs in the area, and a lack of good soil downstream from the fault.\r\n\r\nWildlife commonly seen in the area includes deer, elk, bighorn sheep, pronghorns, coyotes, bobcats, weasels, marmots, porcupines, rabbits, wild turkeys and eagles.  Mountain lions and foxes are seen on rare occasions. What remains of forests in the Hell Canyon basin, are mostly comprised of ponderosa pine, birch, aspen, box elder and willows.  Mountain mahogany shrubs are common, as are cactus, yucca and sagebrush in the lower elevations.  Up to 90% of the forests in this region were burned by the terrible Jasper Fire of 2000, when about 130 square miles were burned.\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=43.73840&amp;distance_lon_9=-103.84530&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">43.73840\u00b0N/103.8453\u00b0W</a>", "Maps": "\u00a0Water Draw Spring RoadTwo helpful maps for the area include the National Geographic Black Hills South map, as well as the Motor Vehicle Use Map for the Black Hills National Forest.

However, there are other exploration possibilities permissible in the canyon.  This section will cover three publicly accessible routes, plus options.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Canyons Trail RouteThe Canyons Trail:  This trail is the one most frequently used for hiking into Hell Canyon, since it lies entirely within Jewel Cave National Monument.  The trailhead is at the Jewel Cave Visitors Center.  There is no admission fee to enter the monument, nor are there parking fees.  The only fees are for cave tours.  Jewel Cave National Monument lists this trail at 3.5 miles for the loop. There is not a great amount of altitude variation on the loop, between the highpoint and low point, with the difference being a little over 300 feet.  The trail is named for the two canyons used in the trail loop \u2013 Hell Canyon and Lithograph Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Canyons Trail could be divided into three basic segments.  The first segment runs from the Visitors Center to the picnic area near the old cave entrance.  It is about one mile in length.  For 3 \u00bd months of each year, the picnic area is open and can also be used as a trailhead, since the old cave entrance there is where the trail drops down into the second segment. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Lithograph CanyonThe second segment follows the floor of Hell Canyon, and is about 1.5 miles long.  It passes by occasional groves of trees, rocky canyon walls and barren areas.  This area is where the forest fire devastation is still most visible. The stream on the canyon floor is normally dry.  At the mouth of Lithograph Canyon, where it transitions to the third part, the trail begins a more northerly direction.\r\n\r\nThe Lithograph Canyon section of the Canyons Trail is close to one mile long.  Depending on your choice of direction on the Canyons Trail, it can be the end or beginning of your loop from the Visitors Center.  The Lithograph Canyon portion of the trail is also the shadiest section, with many trees and beautiful rock walls along the way.\r\n\r\nClick here to view the Canyons Trail Photo Album\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\u00a0Hell Canyon Trail RoutesHell Canyon Trail:  This trail is usually considered the most scenic, as it traverses the deepest and narrowest portions of Hell Canyon and West Hell Canyon.  The National Forest Service, which administers this trail, lists it as a 5.3 mile loop. The altitude range for much of this route is roughly 5300 feet at the canyon floor and 5800 feet at the trail\u2019s highpoint on the canyon rim.  The trailhead is about 1 mile west of the main entrance to Jewel Cave National Monument.  Trail brochures assume you will hike this loop in a clockwise manner, but there is no requirement to do so.  Assuming you do, the first \u00bd mile is spent ascending the side of the canyon.  The next couple miles are fairly level, much of which traverses a bench above the canyon.  There is also a \u00bd mile spur trail that leads to an overlook along the way, if you are interested.   \r\n\r\n\r\nNear the northern end of the loop, the trail drops 300 feet or so, back down to the canyon floor.  Once on the canyon floor, the trail begins curving back toward a more southerly direction.  There is a large amount of vegetation on the canyon floor, and the forest service advises ticks are in abundance here, so take whatever precautions you prefer.  About \u00be of a mile from the trailhead, you will pass the junction of Hell Canyon and West Hell Canyon (the upper half of this trail loop is in West Hell Canyon).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Small herd of bighorn sheepAt that junction, you will find a faint old 2-track road that goes up Hell Canyon.  At 2.3 miles up that road, there is another junction with a side canyon on Short Fork Creek.  This 2.3 mile section of Hell Canyon is probably the most scenic section of Hell Canyon that is not officially designated as a trail.  This old 2-track road (yellow on the route map) shows up on older maps as FSR284.2L.  On the newer forest service motor vehicle use maps, this section has been left out.  If you have the time to hike this as an \u201cout-and-back\u201d in addition to the loop, you may extend your canyon adventure.\r\n\r\nAlong the last \u00be mile of the loop, you will notice the flowing stream has disappeared.  If you also noticed an asphalt section on the trail, it is speculated that it was somehow part of the work done by the CCC Camp in Hell Canyon from 1935-1939. \r\n \r\n\r\nClick here to view the Hell Canyon Trail Photo Album  \r\n\r\nNational Forest Service Information for the Hell Canyon Trail\r\n\r\nNote:  Exploring further up into the Hell Canyon system from the Hell Canyon Trail is possible, since most of it is on public lands.  But, it is less scenic because the canyons pretty much turn into dry creek valleys, and the forests are almost non-existent for a number of miles.  The one exception is the Hell Canyon section from FSR681 to FSR284.2A.  The canyon there is shallower and has less vegetation, but would still make a good hike. \r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Hell Canyon Road RouteHell Canyon Road (FSR277):  Most people who visit this lower part of Hell Canyon, usually do so by motorized vehicle.  Due to minimal traffic on this road, hiking this road is another reasonable way to see the lower portions of Hell Canyon.  FSR277, Hell Canyon Road, is about 2 miles west of the main entrance to Jewel Cave National Monument.  It is not well-marked, so make sure you are watching for that turn-off.\r\n\r\nFrom Highway 16, it is about 1.3 miles to the canyon floor.  There is a junction there and you will see to the left a closed gate at the boundary of Jewel Cave National Monument.  Of course this means go back or go down the canyon.  Your public lands exploring options will last for the next 12 miles down the canyon until you start traveling though all private property.  And by the time you get to that private property area, the canyon is flattening out, since it is not far from there to where the Hell Canyon watershed merges with Pass Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Hell Canyon basin is almost entirely on public lands.  However, there are a few areas of private land in the bottom of the canyon, where you will find some ranches.  Most of them run some cattle on the public lands in the canyon, so wherever you choose to explore off of Hell Canyon Road, please make sure you watch for \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs and close cattle gates behind you if you find any.\r\n\r\nA couple noteworthy side routes you will encounter, include FSR 274 Pass Creek Road (a branch of the main Pass Creek Road \u2013 FSR273), FSR 694 Water Draw Spring and FSR277.2A McKenna Spring.  You may see other faint old roads/trails along the way, but these are the main ones.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Hell Canyon RoadThe Pass Creek side route takes you about 4 miles through some pretty heavily forested areas before you come to the main Pass Creek Road (FSR273).  When you see the road, you will realize this does not get much traffic, and if you decide to hike this route you will most likely have the whole area to yourself.\r\n\r\nIt is only about \u00bd mile to Water Draw Spring from FSR277, and there is a loop road/trail that goes to the south past it.  Despite 2014 being a very rainy year in the Black Hills, there was not much water here when I visited it.\r\n\r\nMcKenna Spring is probably \u00bd mile or less off Hell Canyon Road, in a wooded area.  Though McKenna Spring is on public land, this part of the canyon to the east of the road is all private property \u2013 an area to be aware of trespassing concerns.\r\n\r\nAll this would be a huge expedition if one were to hike the whole length of Hell Canyon Road, plus side roads & trails. Studying good maps and bringing the proper gear and plenty of water before venturing into this part of Hell Canyon would be definitely advisable.\r\n\r\nClick here to view the Hell Canyon Road Photo Album\r\n", "When To Explore": "\u00a0Approaching StormThe canyon is pretty much open to the public year around.  Even though Jewel Cave reduces their hours of operation during the winter months, the Canyons Trail is still open.

{"Activities": "Canyoneering", "Getting there": "Hell Gill is in the north west of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, in northern England. More accurately it straddles the border of the Dales with the Lake District National Park, of Cumbria. The border actually follows Hell Gill Beck precisely for a substantial distance and so a person traversing the canyon will have each foot in a different county. However, the surrounding countryside is more typical of the Yorkshire Dales than the Lake District - and the spelling is Hell Gill, not (Lakeland) Ghyll \u2013 so in terms of ownership, it looks like Yorkshire got the upper hand. The nearest centres are Hawes (south-east) and Kirkby Stephen (north). Road connections: Major north-south roads accessing the region are the motorways of M6 to the west and A1(M) to the east. Connecting these two motorway routes to the south of the region is the A684, which passes through Hawes as it traverses the northern Dales. In the north the M6 and A1(M) are connected by A66, which passes through Brough, just to the north of Kirby Stephen. From the south: A few kilometres west of Hawes along the A684 there is a crucial turning north onto the B6259 (connecting the A684,at Garsdale Head, to Kirby Stephen 12km to the north). The turning is easily identified by the proximity to the Moorcock Inn. Heading north from here along the B6259 the railway (Settle to Carlisle Line) can soon be identified to the left of the road. About 3km from the Moorcock Inn the B6259 passes underneath the railway \u2013 such that the latter now appears to the right and is soon about 100m away. A further kilometre later is a right turn onto an un-metalled (\u2018white\u2019) farm road which heads east towards the railway track. This right turn is identified by road signs (on B6259) marking the border between the two counties and the presence of some farm buildings just beyond and on the same RH side as the turning. The \u2018white road\u2019 is followed for 100m to a gate and bridge over the railway line. At this point there is a small widening with room for 2-3 cars to park. From here Hell Gill can be approached on foot and is some 1.5km distant.(If the spaces are taken up there are more parking bays a short distance further on up the B6259) From the north: The A66 is followed to Brough, where a turning is taken south to Kirby Stephen. Soon after the town center and church in Kirby Stephen, a crucial left turn is made onto the B6259 (signed Hawes). This road is followed for about 10km further south passing through the tiny hamlets of Nateby, Outhgill and finally Aisgill. A few hundred metres beyond Aisgill just after farm buildings on the left and at the point where road signs(on B6259) mark the border between the two counties there is a final left turn onto the un-metalled (\u2018white\u2019) farm road described above. Follow this for 100m to the small parking area just before the gate and bridge over railway. (If the spaces are taken up more parking bays will have been passed on B6259 a short distance before the turn off)GoogleMap image showing position of Hell Gill in northern England\u00a0GoogleMap image showing position of Hell Gill in relation to nearby roads\u00a0", "Route through Hell Gill": "As above there are no route finding difficulties. Options are forwards and backwards only \u2013 and the latter with increasing difficulty. Even a Yosemite or Verdon Gorge rock athlete would probably struggle to find a viable rock-climbing route up the dark slippery and moss encrusted and often overhanging walls of Hell Gill.Google Earth view showing full extent of Hell Gill in relation to farm, bridge and pine tree plantation Hell Gill can be divided into 3 sections, the middle of which being the deepest and narrowest \u2013 and where the crux and at least theoretical point of no return exists. StartThe entrance to Hell Gill is easily identified as above, at the far end of the pine cultivation. A benign looking stream can be seen wending its way down a shallow depression in open grassy fell side \u2013 and then there is an abrupt transition and a total character change. Craggy rock appears around and within the beck, which immediately begins a stepped descent via a series of mini-waterfalls, each about a foot high. This soon has the effect of turning the rock into distinct walls \u2013 which soon tower over head \u2013 and the now lively and noisy beck disappears into a dark somber looking cleft and round a bend \u2013 and out of sight\u2026 The benign stream coming down from Hugh Seat peat bogs......and the transformation at the entrance to Hell GillLooking back up 'the steps'\u00a0Stepping carefully over the little waterfalls and mindful of a slippery scum of vegetation adorning some of the rocks in these parts it is nevertheless fairly straight forward to make this initial descent to and round the initial bend, which is fairly narrow and has a cavern like feel, with close set walls apparently bending overhead and shutting off the light.Once around the bend the beck levels off again, but at the same time the outside appears to have been shut off behind \u2013 further adding to the impression of having entered a totally different and alien world. The walls are probably no more than about 8m high at this point and further apart \u2013 but the atmosphere is surreal and still a bit cave-like with dark wet rock liberally plastered with great splashes of iridescent green moss. It could be a scene from Lord of the Rings. Spectators from an even more imaginative time could be forgiven for likening it to the insides of Jonah\u2019s whale. This colourful section feels horizontal, although it will be sloping gently downhill \u2013 and heads in a straight line for some distance before the next bend and another character change. The water throughout this section is never more than knee deep \u2013 under normal conditions in fairly dry weather.Guide with either client or inexperienced partner near the start......and just before the first 'Lord of the Rings' section \u00a0Middle sectionAt the end of the long straight mossy section the walls close in and it becomes gloomy and cavern like again. There are a couple of steps downwards \u2013 with lively little waterfalls, a little larger than those at the start \u2013 and use of the hands is needed to negotiate a bit of scrambling. Between the waterfalls are narrow chamber like sections where unbroken fast but smooth flowing water completely spans the 1m/3 foot diameter of the cleft at this point. In the last of these it is just deep enough to swim a few strokes.Looking back at Lord of the Rings section......and onwards into the narrower and more cave-like.....Hell Gill middle section, approaching the cruxAfter some distance the rocky cleft abruptly narrows to its narrowest yet \u2013 and the crux is reached. Noise levels are rising as this feature is approached \u2013 and it is soon apparent that the majority of the cacophony is coming from a waterfall squeezing through this narrowing \u2013 and plunging 1.5m or 5 feet into a bowl shaped chamber below. There is a fixed rope here, of black 11mm caving line \u2013 which hangs horizontally across the next chamber and for some distance beyond, to an anchor point high up on the left hand wall of the canyon and some 20m distant. The far attachment is about 5m above the floor of the canyon,which descends that amount over the distance \u2013 in two steps, starting with the \u2018drop\u2019 into the bowl. There is more than one way of negotiating the next obstacle. The dark swirling water in the bowl below is a good 2-2.5m deep so safe to jump into. The bold approach is to launch over the edge and plunge into the maelstrom close to the foot of the waterfall. Trying to slide or brace across and lower oneself to a lower dropping point is not very easy and risks injury to clothes if not self. The rocky walls taper outwards and the waterfall packs more than enough punch to swat the most determined limpet into the depths below. The other thing is that the rock here is completely devoid of vegetation and not at all slippery - and actually quite rough, despite the wetness \u2013 so attempts to slither down the fall liable to result in leaving little bits of skin or (preferably) wet-suit behind. It is better to be bold \u2013 and just jump! (I now have a hole in a pair of wetsuit shorts!)The crux......and Keith showing the fixed rope......and looking back at the crux - the drop into the deep plunge poolThe drop into the bowl is big enough to result in jumper becoming completely submerged for an instant \u2013 so not the best move for someone with an aversion to immersion in cold water or swimming \u2013 or both. For those who do like such things I can personally vouch for the pleasure to be experienced from swimming a few laps around the little bowl, before clambering over the rim \u2013 and negotiating the next section. For the benefit of those with an aversion to being immersed in cold water I feel duty bound (but reluctant) to point out that it is possible to cheat \u2013 and to completely avoid the plunge: my 6\u20194\u2019\u2019 son demonstrated that it was easy for him to swing hand over hand along the fixed rope \u2013 with just his rubber encased toes dangling in the water \u2013 to then make land-fall on the rim of the scramble down to the next chamber. The fixed rope goes much further, but with the increasing drop below I would not recommend continuing along the rope without use of a harness and carabiner. This is in fact exactly what some do - completely bypassing the entire section by using the rope as a Tyrolean traverse (seems a bit of a shame to me) \u00a0The next and somewhat elongated chamber is about another 2m below, but the drop is not vertical this time \u2013 and can be negotiated via a somewhat wet scramble \u2013 mostly half inside the next bit of waterfall. The next water \u2018pool\u2019 is marked by a rather spectacular little rock arch \u2013 which can be passed underneath. It is possible to have another little swim here. Initially the water is too shallow but it soon deepens to just above waist deep, for enough of a distance to enjoy a few careful strokes.Next section with the rock arch and next 'swimming pool'In the deepest part of the canyon\u00a0 In all of this middle section the beck descends fairly steeply whilst the top of the cleft stays at nearly the same height. The net effect is that the deepest parts of Hell Gill are to be found just beyond the plunge pool, in the vicinity of the \u2018second chamber\u2019. It is very gloomy even on a bright summer\u2019s day and there is the distinct impression of being in a deep cave, completely enclosed on all sides. But then the floor of the cavern widens again \u2013 and it gets lighter \u2013 and there is more of an impression of a narrow strip of sky, albeit largely obscured by overhanging trees, but clearly visible far above. With the widening (if blessed with a sunny day) a few golden beams of sunlight pierce the gloom and illuminate bits of the canyon floor and walls.Hell Gill deepest part, looking up......and another 50m or so later, the bridge......and the walls are getting lower nowFinal sectionIf the first section is the most surreal and the middle the hardest and most cave-like the third and final section is the prettiest part of the canyon \u2013 particularly on a sunny day. There is more vegetation again \u2013 but with sunbeams penetrating in places and the remaining light passing through leaves parts of the canyon walls appear to glow and it is quite beautiful. Having said that I have passed through twice on bright sunny summer\u2019s days \u2013 and imagine it could be quite different on a dull day \u2013 or in winter. The start of this next and final section is marked by the widening of the canyon \u2013 but also by the bridge, which appears high overhead. It is worth pausing to compare the impressions looking up \u2013 with those of looking down from the bridge perhaps an hour in the past. I would estimate the walls of the canyon as being about 20m high at this point. From this point on a long section of the stream is almost horizontal but the hillside far above is a little steeper \u2013 so the walls of the canyon gradually become lower.Back to the Lord of the Rings scenery in the final and easy section With the widening the beck no longer takes up all of the canyon floor and with the increased vegetation rocks are getting slippery again \u2013 and it is makes for easier going walking on the drier stones beside the stream at times. The canyon walls continue lowering until back down to about 8m height \u2013 at which point they level off for some distance ahead in another fairly straight section of the canyon. With all the vegetation appearing again it looks similar to the \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 section close to the start of Hell Gill, the main differences being that the walls are not so overhanging and there appears to be daylight appearing between them looking straight ahead, as opposed to dark cleft. At a slight bend in the beck at the end of the straight section the canyon walls abruptly move apart and there is a complete change of scene \u2013 again. It is back out into the light which feels dazzling after the gloom. The beck has turned into a small shallow river with green grassy banks with a few low trees sprouting in places. The canyon walls are still there but much lower and further away \u2013 and dry now, as well as exposed to the light, have returned to white limestone appearance (quite dazzling if in the sun).Just before the exit of Hell Gill - beware slippery!Just after the exit and trying to find the exit from the stream Over the next hundred or so meters the Gill metamorphoses from a rocky canyon to a steep sided but shallow grassy valley with tangled vegetation and bushes either side of the river. It soon becomes possible to climb out to the left in a few places \u2013 but the exit from the Gill is actually a little further on and to the right. The end comes almost unexpectedly \u2013 and care needs to be taken not to miss it.There is an abrupt narrowing of the valley as the river turns into fairly impressive waterfall dropping a meter or so down into a large pool. It looks tempting for a plunge \u2013 but two things: firstly it is too shallow to swim and not to be recommended to jump into, but secondly if you scramble down the waterfall it would be difficult to get back up again \u2013 and the exit is just before the waterfall. Up on the right a few meters back from the waterfall there is an abrupt end to a 2 meter high section of limestone canyon wall \u2013 marked by a tree sprouting out of the top. A much lower dry-stone wall also appears to sprout from the end of the canyon wall just underneath the tree. A short muddy track ascends from the river edge to the join between limestone canyon wall and dry stone wall, which is easily scrambled over \u2013 to find same grassy meadow just above the farm, which was passed through on the approach to Hell Gill.Looking back at the exit from Hell Gill from beside exit from the streamKeith looking at the exit: the muddy track up the bank and over the wall", "Approach to Hell Gill": "Parking area by the gate and railway bridge at start of walk to Hell GillAt the parking area looking back towards\u00a0B6259 main road.The entrance of Hell Gill is 1.5km away from the parking area by the railway bridge, heading in an easterly direction. Route finding is not difficult, although the canyon itself is completely hidden from view until you are practically falling into it. However the position of it is marked by a small rather lonely looking block of forestry, adjacent to small collection of farm buildings, which is visible from the parking area. Note that the forestry, which is a pine plantation, spans about half of the northern rim of Hell Gill (so to the right and beyond the trees as viewed from below).Google Earth image showing parking area in relation to Hell GillOn the ground view of part of the same - closer up. You'd have no idea it was therePass through the gate and follow the un-metalled (\u2018white\u2019) farm road as it bends to left (north) and then back to the east, over a little bridge over Hell Gill Beck \u2013 and on through meadows to the farm. Pass through another gate and go through the farm into a gently rising meadow beyond. At the top of the meadow is a wall followed by the patch of forestry cultivation on the northern bank of Hell Gill, which is visible beyond. Note that the exit of Hell Gill is near the bottom end of the meadow and can be accessed by crossing an obvious breech in the wall\u2026White road to the farm close to first little bridge over Hell Gill BeckView into the middle section of Hell Gill from the stone bridge Walk to the top end of the meadow and climb over the wall on little steps \u2013 to join a rambler\u2019s track which crosses Hell Gill via a stone bridge just to the right. The walls of the bridge are surprisingly high and views are further obscured by a thicket of tree branches. Nevertheless it is worth taking some time out to peer over the wall \u2013 and gain a first impression of the objective. Immediately below is approximately the mid point of the chasm, where the rocky walls are at their highest and whilst somewhat restricted, the view into the grim dark abyss is worth seeing. It is not far now to the entrance of Hell Gill, which is at the far end of the pine plantation sprouting on the northern edge of the Gill. Facing uphill it is possible to reach the entrance passing to either side of the patch of forestry \u2013 but it is more direct (and better views) to go to the right and pass to the south \u2013 where a path follows fencing preventing access to the forestry but also too close access to the edge of the canyon, which can be presumed to be treacherous.

It is good just to look at - but if you climb over the fence and battle your way down through the bracken (beware of sheep ticks!) then another 'wild swim' awaits at the bottom.\u00a0", "Dangers": "Weather: in normal dry summer conditions the water levels in the Gill are low and easily manageable. However, with the source of the stream a mere 2-3 kilometers away up in the bogs below Hugh Seat it is easy to guess that water levels could rise swiftly if it rains. It takes a minimum of about 30 minutes to traverse the canyon \u2013 but some may take an hour or more if unused to scrambling on slippery rock. If there was a sudden cloud burst my impression is that you could be caught out. The message is don\u2019t try to traverse the canyon in anything other than stable dry conditions. Cold: I didn\u2019t take the temperature in the beck when I traversed Hell Gill late summer in 2016, but from Wild Swimming experience in similar streams and rivers in the UK I guess the temperature to have been between 12-14\u00b0C (53-57\u00b0F). In early summer or late autumn the temperature could be in the vicinity of 10\u00b0C (50\u00b0F) In winter the temperature could well be 5\u00b0C (41\u00b0F) or less. If not acclimatised to cold water these kind of temperatures can induce cold shock\u00a0- hence use of a wet-suit advisable if you are going to \u2018take the plunge\u2019\u2026Injury: the water in Hell Gill Beck is from peat bog and so it is brownish coloured, a bit like wading through beer (or for the teetotal: weak black tea) In addition any light reaching the bottom of the Gill is somewhat reduced. The net effect is that in some of the deeper water you cannot see what you are treading on - and the bed of the stream is very rocky. Another issue is that whereas in the middle and deepest section of the Gill the rocks are devoid of vegetation and pleasantly rough, at the entrance and exit there is a lot of moss and other greenery \u2013 and many of the rocks are extremely slippery. The overall message is that the risk of an ankle or foot injury is quite high \u2013 and pose proportionately the greatest risk of harm in Hell Gill. Reasonable balance and confidence walking on slippery surfaces is highly desirable \u2013 and even for an experienced person not a good idea to hurry too much (worst case scenario: broken leg plus stuck down the canyon - and then a thunderstorm with torrential rain... in the words of Clint Eastwood: this could ruin your day)Mountain Rescue:\u00a0Swaledale & Wensleydale Cave & Mountain Rescue Team are the local rescue organisation.\u00a0In emergency dial 999 and ask for Police & mountain rescue.

For summer conditions a \u2018shortie\u2019 windsurfer wet-suit I picked up at a supermarket was more than adequate. I also managed fine wearing a combination of Gul neoprene 2mm shorts and 1.5mm vest. My son who has an aversion to cold water completely avoided all swimming and went hand over hand along the fixed rope as well as spidering his way along the canyon walls - which made me realise that the canyon could have been done without a wet-suit in relatively dry conditions and in summer \u2013 and wearing normal clothes above the waist. In winter I would suggest a full length wet-suit with boots and gloves. Thick soled wetsuit shoes: feet are going to be immersed in cold water throughout most of the route and take something of a bashing from rocks. Ordinary swim shoes are fine for the beach but provide scant protection for a rocky canyon. I used Gul 3mm neoprene wet-suit shoes with Velcro strap which provided just enough protection to prevent bruising \u2013 and were ideal for swimming. My son used a pair of Vibram Fivefinger sports shoes which were slightly grippier for the scrambling he did in order to avoid swimming. We encountered one clearly experienced man guiding an inexperienced woman and he was wearing wellington boots (seen in photos above). He was also wearing hill clothes and intended to use climbing or caving gear to traverse the full length of the fixed rope \u2013 thus avoiding the two \u2018swimming pools\u2019. He clearly knew the canyon and what he was doing and so could get away with using \u2018wellies\u2019. Gloves: wet-suit gloves were ideal to both protect hands from abrasion and also from cold. Not essential in summer \u2013 but a must in winter. Helmet: part of normal canyoning equipment. Local Outward Bound organisations who take students through Hell Gill equip them with helmets (as well as full length wet-suits). This seems sensible \u2013 but I have to confess I didn\u2019t take one. Climbing/caving hardware: a harness, short sling and carabiner needed if intending to use the full length of the fixed rope. I didn\u2019t take any hardware on either of my two visits to the canyon \u2013 although my son went hand over hand along start of the fixed rope to avoid getting wet! (see movie!)", "Created/Edited": "Sep25,2016/Sep25,2016", "Overview": "\n            At the time of writing there were 369 canyons featuring in SP. Predictably 80% were in USA (not a criticism \u2013 you just have to think Grand Canyon \u2013 and there is little more to be said\u2026) Runners up, but a long way behind, were countries of Greece, Italy, Mexico, Spain and Montenegro, Iran and France. (Also) predictably there were no canyons listed for all of the UK. Not even one. I\u2019m a beginner at canyons and not very good at them, but it is my privilege nevertheless to submit my first canyon page \u2013 and first on SummitPost for all of the UK. Hopefully even proper canyoneers will not be too harsh on me for choosing Hell Gill. Hell Gill is a slot-canyon. It is mere 500m long and with walls no more than about 20m high. It isn\u2019t a Grand Canyon, or a Verdon Gorge, not by along chalk. However, it is arguably the best Gill (or Ghyll)\u00a0scramble in the Yorkshire Dales of England. And being Limestone country there are loads. In fact half of north Yorkshire is riddled with holes and slots a bit like the proverbial Swiss cheese. Cavers have an absolute ball \u2013 even some of the more distant readers may have heard of Gaping Gill.Tolkein-esk section of Hell Gill about 100m inSlot-canyons are what happens when a river or stream scours its way across soft rock over a few millennia. If it does so in the same place without moving about it eventually wears a deep groove or slot \u2013and you get your canyon. Hell Gill is no exception \u2013 and the river is known as Hell Gill Beck. The source arises just a few kilometres away to the east in the peat bogs just below the top of Hugh Seat 689m 2,260ft. The initial stretch of the stream which is formed is called Red Gill Beck \u2013 but this soon turns into Hell Gill Beck as it slices into the underlying limestone and forms Hell Gill. Being quite deep and very narrow, much of Hell Gill feels more like a cave than a slot. With the abrupt transition from (if you are lucky) sunny fell (hill) side to dark dingy interior shut off from the sun, it is possible to understand why it has been compared to the interior of the Whale which swallowed Jonah, in the Biblical fable. This effect is further added to by trees over-hanging the top for most of the length \u2013 which further softens what little light reaches the moss encrusted and in places overhanging walls of the gill. The overall effect is highly atmospheric.Much of Hell Gill feels more like a cave than a slot The traverse of Hell Gill is done from top to bottom. Being alone on my first visit I considered the more cautious approach of exploring it from the bottom end first. But Hell Gill is practically invisible until you virtually fall into it \u2013 and the position of the exit difficult to find, unless you have been before and know what you are looking for. So I did the normal thing and went through from top to bottom \u2013 with the flow of the stream. In contrast to the exit, the entrance is very easy to find, as will be seen from detailed description below. The canyon bottom is very narrow and often entirely taken up with the stream. The good news is there are no route finding difficulties. The canyon walls are impossible to climb so choices of route are forwards \u2013 or backwards, until even that option becomes near impossible (unless the fixed rope is used \u2013 see below). There are occasional sections where it is possible to scramble on the rocks at the edge of the stream, but for the most it is a matter of wading \u2013 and there are 3 places where it is possible to swim, albeit briefly. The stream bed is rocky and care is required to avoid turning an ankle. Being effluent from a peat bog the water is brownish \u2013 like walking through fast flowing beer. The net effect, what with the dim light, is that you often can\u2019t where you are placing your feet. \u00a0In average conditions the water is mostly little more than knee deep, but there are a few stretches of waste deep \u2013 and thereare frequent little \u2018steps\u2019 with little waterfalls leading further into the depths. The crux \u2013 and (theoretical) point of no return \u2013 is a drop of about 5 feet into a sort of chamber, where there is no choice but to swim (unless fixed rope is used). If we are talking Whale entrails then this chamber would be the stomach...\u00a0", "Red tape": "There is no permit required nor bureaucracy to contend with.

Geologically the groundwork for the canyon was laid in the last ice age when glaciers ground away all soft material in what is now Breitachtal (Kleines Walsertal). After retreating the glacier creeks had to cut through the hard dolomite rock (main dolomite) to form this very impressive canyon. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAs usual within any inhabited mountain area a gorge like this was deemed the home of the devil. \"H\u00f6llenschlucht\", Hell Canyon, it was called and only few people dared to get near. Before the turn of the century 1900 the first locals tried to make the gorge accessible to the public but it took until 1901, when a new priest, Johannes Schiebel, started on his own plansto create a trail through the gorge. In 1904 the work was started and on July 4th 1905 it was completed. Ever since Breitachklamm has been one of the main attractions of the Oberstdorf area.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe canyon is closed during the time of snow melting since huge amounts of awter press through. Occasionally, but rather regularly, these floods are so strong that they take away much of the trail. In recent years, floods destroyed the bridges and protection in the years 1996, 1999, 2000 and - most devastating - in 2005. In that year days of torrential rains produced a flood, which in the narrowest part of the gorge, rose to more than 6m (18feet) above the hiking trail, which itself is leads across the creek 4m above its regular level. In that year any construction, created by humans in the canyon was washed away.\r\n\r\nA year later everything was back and again you can hike the cave-like canyon on protected trails and bridges. Breitachklamm is a popular bad weather destination as you'll get wet in any case and there's little light in the canyon even on sunny days. Most popular and most beautiful are winter visits when the creek freezes over and the Klamm tuns into a crystal cave of ice.

", "Overview": "\n            The Tule River is one of the smaller rivers in California.  Its headwaters are along the Great Western Divide, a sub-range of mountains that run parallel to the Sierra Crest in Tulare County in Central California.  It flows in a westerly direction and eventually reaches Success Reservoir.  It has three main forks, the North, Middle, and South, which flow down through rugged deep canyons.  The North Fork and Middle Fork join together just above the town of Springville.  The South Fork joins the two at the reservoir.  The river then flows on to Porterville and, in historic times and during rare floods, the river flows on to join the Kings, Kaweah, and Kern Rivers at Tule Lake.  Tule Lake was at one time the largest freshwater lake in America west of the Mississippi.  Along the shores of this lake are marshlands called tular and the reeds and cattails that grow in them are called tules.\r\n\r\nThe Tule River originates among high rugged granite peaks including Dennison Peak, Moses Mountain, Maggie Mountain, Jordan Peak, Slate Mountain, Black Mountain, Mule Peak, and Parker Peak.  It descends as much as 1,000 for every mile and altogether drops more than 9,000 feet.  It flows past several spectacular groves of giant sequoia, the largest trees on the planet.  The largest known giant sequoia in the Tule River Watershed is the Stagg Tree, the 5th largest tree on Earth.  This tree grows in the Alder Creek Grove on the flanks of Jordan Peak.\r\n\r\nAfter flowing through the majestic conifer forest belt the river enters the chaparral and oak woodland communities with their abundant wildlife.  Then it flows into the San Joaquin Valley which is world famous for the quantity and quality of its agricultural products.\r\n\r\nLower elevations in the San Joaquin Valley and foothills may only receive a few inches of rain a year, but the mountains can receive up to 50.   In an average year almost 50 billion gallons of water flow through 100 miles of the Tule River and its tributaries.  So the Tule River, though relatively small, has a big impact on the area where it flows.  \r\n\r\nThe earliest people in California settled and traveled along rivers and the Tule River was the home of the Yaundanchi Yokuts.  As early as 1776 white men visited the area but it wasn\u2019t until the middle of the 19th century that any of them stayed.  \r\n\r\nThe first sawmill was built along the North Fork of the Tule River in 1865.  By 1866 farmers were building ditches to help irrigate their lands with Tule River water near Porterville.  Then the railroad came through in 1873 and this led to widespread farming and settlement.  By 1890 there were nearly 25,000 people settled in the Tule River area.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 a large portion of the Tule River Watershed was designated as Sequoia National Forest.  Another large portion along the South Fork is a part of the Tule River Indian Reservation that was originally established in 1857 and moved to its present location in 1873.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 another use of the river began when a hydroelectric plant was built.  By 1913 another one was operating along the Middle Fork of the Tule River.  Among the uses of the electricity was to power irrigation pumps to increase the value of farmland.\r\n\r\nRoads that were built to access the power plants led to the development of several home tracts along the Middle Fork of the Tule River.  Camp Wishon and Camp Nelson were two popular resorts in the early 20th century.  At the height of its popularity, Camp Nelson had a two-story hotel, a six-hole golf course, an outdoor dance platform, and many cabins and stores.  Though not as popular today, both places continue to operate.  Today there are approximately 1,000 homes in the Upper Tule River Watershed and more than 100 are occupied year-round.\r\n\r\nThousands of people today not only live beside and depend on the water of the Tule River, they also go to the river and Lake Success to play!  Fishing, hunting, picnicking, camping, boating, hiking, mountain bike riding, ATV and snowmobile riding, and even hang-gliding are all popular sports in the Tule River area.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the Tule River area has proven itself popular for other activities such as illegal marijuana cultivation and graffiti spraying.  The Forest Service along with several law enforcement agencies fight to clean up areas and keep them safe for the public.  \r\n\r\nI have lived along the Tule River for almost 5 years now, first in a cabin up at Camp Nelson and now in a small house in Springville.  I have explored many of its stretches and have delighted in its many waterfalls.  I have searched for pictographs and mortar holes and other signs of early habitants along it.  I have hiked and backpacked along most of the Tule River area trails.  I have trekked through many of its sequoia groves and in short I enjoy every minute I spend outside near the Tule River.  \r\n", "Red Tape": "The upper reaches of the Middle Fork of the Tule River lie in the Golden Trout Wilderness.

In general terms, the canyon's north end is where Highway 2 crosses over the Wenatchee River, and the canyon's south end is at the city of Leavenworth. The canyon is bordered on its western side by Alpine Lakes Wilderness and Icicle Ridge, and on its eastern side by Tumwater Mountain and an unnamed ridge located north of it.\r\nLooking North In Tumwater Canyon\r\nThe canyon is estimated to be 3000' deep and nine miles long. In geology, most of the canyon rocks are of quartz diorite composition. The canyon is gradually sloped, and, as such, the highest point of Tumwater Canyon cannot be seen from the lowest point.\r\nTumwater Canyon (Photo Taken By Martin Cash)\r\nThe canyon is quite popular, for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, Highway 2, one of the busiest interstate highways in the Northwest, passes through the entire length of the canyon. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people drive through the canyon during most weekends throughout each year.\r\n\r\nSecond, and perhaps most importantly to SummitPost, the canyon is a great place for hiking, peakbagging, rock-climbing, and even some ice-climbing. Both Icicle Ridge and Tumwater Mountain are popular hiking destinations. Each of these mountains also have multiple rock-climbing areas, especially at Josephine Crag near the northeastern end of Icicle Ridge and Castle Rock near the southwestern end of Tumwater Mountain.\r\nCastle Rock, A Popular Rock-Climbing Area\r\nIce-climbing has also been known to occur in Tumwater Canyon, especially at Drury Falls, a 1267' high tiered waterfall as Fall Creek enters the canyon from Icicle Ridge. Coincidentally, the only location to see the entire Drury Falls waterfall system is from near the summit of Tumwater Mountain, located on the other side of the canyon.\r\nDrury Falls (Photo Taken By Paul Klenke)\r\nAnother major recreational activity within the canyon is river usage. The Wenatchee River is a famous area for whitewater rafting and paddling. Four big water rapids sections as high as Class V, on the Wenatchee River within Tumwater Canyon, are quite popular during late Spring and early Summer. These rapids sections are called \"The Wall\", \"Chaos Cascade\", \"Perfection Of Whitewater\" (a.k.a. \"POW\"), and \"Last Exit\".", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Location": "Washington,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

I would recommend a different loop - hike towards the Tunnel, climb to the mesa top and instead of hiking north, head east and descend into the canyon to the east of the one with the Tunnel formation (see the map).

There is a lower trail, better worn and closer to the wash - take this one. I made a mistake and took an upper trail with a post showing an image of a rappel, this took me to a side wash and to a different canyon, where I spend 3 hrs exploring and climbing to the top of the mesa. I had no route description with me or a map, just went based on my memory of reading the description on-line.\u00a0\nThe lower trail is more worn, head along and above the north side of the wash in westerly direction. It eventually drops into the wash, and this section could be muddy (I was hiking after a rain). Aim for a cliff on the right, pass its prow (the wall is very narrow from the south), and continue inside the wash. There are several trails here. Basically, I followed some footsteps in the mud, which occasionally disappeared, but I continued west inside the wash, had to even bushwhack a little bit until the wash opened up again. The canyon is very open here. Head for the next big cliff ahead of you, you will be turning north, right before that cliff into a side canyon. I came to an area with 2 small cairns on the bottom of the wash, \u00a0the trail was leaving the wash up a sandy hill to a large slick rock area. Walk north on slick rock and slightly uphill until you start to see an amphitheater on your left. There was again a cairn and trail leading towards the small mushroom rock and an opening in a rock above it. That is the entry into the Tunnel. The slick rock from the mushroom rock to the Tunnel may appear steep to some, but is not that bad. You may need to provide some partner assist to enter the Tunnel, or if alone use a couple of climbing moves. I did not find it difficult and there is a nice flat ledge just below the entry in to the Tunnel, so even if you fall from your attempt to enter the Tunnel, you will end up on this ledge and not rolling down the slick rock slope.\u00a0\nOnce inside the tunnel crawl/walk through it all the way to the other end. You can either scramble out or return back. There is just enough light that you don't need a headlamp. The surrounding area is very scenic and fun just to sit around and relax.\u00a0\nIf the Tunnel is your only objection, return the same way.\nLoop Hike: I have not done this loop hike all the way through, about 90% of it. As above mentioned I originally explored a canyon to the east of the Tunnel canyon, and I climbed all the way to the top of the mesa from this canyon. The other canyon is basically parallel and cca 0.7 miles to the east. The East Canyon is more narrow and I would say even more pretty than the more open canyon with the Tunnel.\u00a0From the Tunnel look for the easiest path in northernly direction to the top of the Mesa. Pass through the boulder field on the way up. Once on the top, head east for cca 0.5 mile and descend into the next canyon running towards south (see photo East Canyon). Initially descend on a nice slick rock. It is easier to be on the right side lower down, but even the left side is fine if you feel comfortable on steep 4th class or very easy 5th class slick rock.

While the seldom-visited canyon of the North Fork of the Sacramento could possibly characterized as such, most of the canyons in the range are simply forested gorges with attractive creeks. At first glance, Ney Springs Canyon would fit this description but beneath the bland veneer of trees on a slope, the canyon harbors some surprisingly fine hidden gems.  Namely, the canyon boasts a beautiful waterfall, some fascinating ruins, a roaring creek, and an excellent, well developed climbing area that is accessible in winter, when most other crags are out of reach.\r\n\u00a0Little Castle Lake at the head of Ney Springs Canyon\r\nWhile the canyon itself is not a spectacular gorge, the eye is still drawn to it because of the striking pinnacle of rock piercing the horizon above the canyon. Castle Spire is visible from throughout the Mount Shasta City area. Though not part of the canyon, this towering formation, the high point of the Castle Crags, is a useful landmark in identifying the location of the canyon. Less prominent though still easily visible is a small peak that some refer to as \u201cLittle Castle Peak\u201d.  The cliffs of this peak constitute the headwall of Ney Springs Canyon.  At the foot of \u201cLittle Castle Peak\u201d is Little Castle Lake, which is the source of Ney Springs Creek.  The lake is surrounded by some attractive meadows and the area has great views of Mount Shasta.  While this is part of the canyon, it is not accessed via the same route as the lower section, where the aforementioned falls, ruins and crags are located.  Rather, Little Castle Lake is accessed via the Castle Lake Trail, climbing out of the Castle Lake basin en route to Mount Bradley.  \r\n\u00a0Ruins of Ney Springs Resort\r\nThe upper portion of Ney Springs Canyon is within the boundary of the Castle Crags Wilderness.  Beyond the wilderness area the canyon retains its wilderness character with the exceptions of two crossings by seldom used Forest Service roads.  This section of the canyon is fairly precipitous, dropping 2,200 feet in nearly 3 miles.  \r\n\r\nAside from Little Castle Lake and the Castle Lake Trail in the uppermost parts of the canyon, most interest is focused in the last miles of the canyon, before Ney Springs Creek joins the Sacramento River.  Here is found Faery Falls, an attractive 40 foot waterfall and the ruins of the Ney Springs Resort, a late 19th century mineral springs resort that is now a mysterious, overgrown ruin.  Between the falls and the ruins, a trail climbs up the side of the canyon and reaches the base of a crag where local climbers have developed a series of routes.  \r\n\r\nNey Springs Resort\r\n\u00a0Ruined fountain at Ney Springs Resort\r\nSeveral resorts centered on springs were founded in the Mount Shasta area in the late 19th century.  The most well known was the Shasta Springs Resort, located just north of Dunsmuir.  Though not as large, the Ney Springs Resort still boasted an extensive complex and drew guests for many years.  John Ney discovered the springs in 1887 and within a few years the resort had been established.  At its height, the resort boasted a hotel that could accommodate 50 people, a bathhouse, and various outbuildings including a barn and a carriage house.  Water was also piped into small structures to house the spring water.  Boardwalks were reportedly constructed through the forest as well.  \r\n\r\nToday, little remains of the resort.  The forest has reclaimed the site, leaving little of the resort\u2019s remnants visible to the naked eye.  The most obvious sections are a large retaining wall that once housed a fountain and another retaining wall leading down to a stone platform next to the creek.  The platform holds a couple of cisterns.  Some of the pipes used to transport the spring water can still be found and in places they have broken and the water continues to flow out of the breach.  A hundred yards or so below the primary ruin, a level, raised area created by piling rocks can be discerned.  Though unconfirmed, this was probably the barn or carriage house.  There seems to have been little effort to uncover more of the resorts ruins.  The way the forest has reclaimed the area gives it an attractive, eerie quality.\r\n\r\nAccess to the falls is simple.  The old road passes through the resort area.  The old fountain is on the north side of the road.  The cisterns are on the left, south, side of the road, down by the creek.  \r\n\r\nFaery Falls\r\n\u00a0Faery Falls\r\nA short distance from the Ney Springs Resort ruins is Faery Falls, an attractive, 40 foot cataract.  Today, the falls is what draw most people into Ney Springs Canyon, though its proximity to the resort suggests it was equally popular to the canyon\u2019s guests in the 19th century.  The fall has two tiers.  At the top of the second tier, the creek splits in two and fans out over the rock.  In low water half of the fan disappears.  \r\n\r\nTo reach the falls, continue past the resort ruins for 0.25 miles.  Pass a cairn-marked use trail leading down to a small fall on the creek just after the ruins.  Beyond this point, note an old road turning right off of the main road.  Just beyond this junction another cairn-marked use trail heads down to the creek, the falls now being quite audible.  There are several good vantages for the falls and it is possible to climb all the way to the base.  \r\n\r\nNey Springs Climbing\r\n\u00a0View across the canyon from the crags\r\nA well developed climbing area has been established at some crags on Ney Springs Canyon\u2019s northern wall.  The area has a couple dozen routes.  The Ney crags are an excellent option for climbers during winter. Being on the north wall of the canyon, the crags get a full days sun, which keeps them free of ice and melts the snow off quickly after a storm.  Furthermore, the area is relatively low elevation snow does not build up too much on the access routes.  If the road to the springs is impassable, which is atypical, it is also possible to access the area by rappelling down from above.  To do so means parking on Castle Lake road and hiking a short distance cross-country.  The only drawback to this option is that it means a short jaunt across some private land.  \r\n\r\nTo access the crag from the canyon, hike past the resort ruins.  Just before the falls, an old road branches off to the right and begins climbing.  A hundred yards or so off the main road there will be a large clearing on the left.  Head into the clearing and look for the use trail heading uphill to the left.  There are usually cairns marking this spot but the trial is pretty obvious from the clearing.  Eventually the use trail will split, leading to different sections of the crag.  \r\n\r\nMore detail on climbing at Ney Springs can be found here.\r\n\r\nViews of climbing area\r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jan27,2011/Feb1,2011", "Maps": "Map of Ney Springs Canyon\r\n\r\nMap of lower Ney Springs Canyon", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=41.25406&amp;distance_lon_9=-122.34512&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">41.25406\u00b0N/122.34512\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "\u00a0Canyon headwall in the Castle Crags Wilderness\r\nPart of the Ney Springs Canyon, specifically the area around and below Little Castle Lake, is in the Castle Crags Wilderness.

It starts as a narrow valley at Sur-En, where the Uina Creek joins the Inn River and is bounded by mountains which tower up to 2000m above the valley floor. Even though the landscape apears to forbid it, two hamlets have been established on the two wider grounds in the valley, Unia Dadora and Uina Dadaint. The outer (dadora) hamlet has been mostly abandoned while in Uina Dadaint you will still find a large farm house, which caters to hikers and mountain bikers. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIt is the place where the narrow vally suddenly closes down to form a canyon, Il Quar, one of the most impressive ones of the whole Alps and thanks to a precariously placed trail, also one of the most popular ones. While access hikes to this canyon are long you will find few hikers but since the canyon is part of the route crossing the Alps on bike, you'll find a lot of mountain bikers there. But don't worry - they are not allowed to ride their bikes - too dangerous and thus push their vehicles up or down the route. The video below explains why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also tells you something about the route itself, which does not run through the centre of the gorge but rather high through its eastern walls. It is a path, which was blasted into the rock between 1908 and 1910 to create a connection between the Swiss Scuol and then Austrian Schlinig / Slingia in S\u00fcdtirol / Alto Adige. After WW I S\u00fcdtirol had to be handed over to Italy, which is why the border between Switzerland and Italy runs across the route today. One of the main reasons to create the route was to establish a northern route to Pforzheimer H\u00fctte, which, however, has been abandoned and replaced by nearby Sesvenna Hut.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAs you will have seen from the video and the pictures on this page, the course of the route is truly amazing. From Uina Dadaint a trail quickly ascends to a lookout, where you can have a wonderful overview across the canyon in case you dare to climb up to it. From this place mountain bikers have to push their bikes, as now the narrow path through the east face of the gorge starts. It is roughly 1.50m wide and cut out of the limestone to form a gallery. There are several short tunnels in the central section. The creekbed finally steeply rises to join the trail right before you head out of the canyon onto Alp Sursass, a plateau like pasture north of the Swiss - Italian border (loaned to the Italian communities for cattle grazing, however).\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe canyon can be hiked (or mtb pushed) from both sides of the border, with the access from Schlinig / Slingia shorter and with 700m less elevation gain.

There is a small trail along the road, which initially parallels the road and then turn away from road towards cliffs and hidden ascent gully. As you get closer, you will get a better view of the ascent gully on your right. The trail is well worn and easy to follow. The gully is the only obvious place to climb the mesa (the remainder are steep sandstone walls).\u00a0Scramble up this gully with a few little climbing moves, it is not very exposed and felt fairly easy. Soon, you will reach the top - stop and admire the views!\nOne on the top of this sandstone gully, do not descend into the small bowl but take a turn right = east staying on the slick rock ridge (Tierdrop and Not Tierdrop canyons would be to the left). Go slightly right on slick rock wide ridge towards a little dome. Bypass this dome on the left on a wide ledge. Immediately, you will see the second dome. It is easy to scramble up and cross to the left (no more than 3rd class). U-Turn Canyon is just behind this dome.\nBehind the second dome, is the start of the U-Turn Canyon. There is a low angle slick rock between two smaller domes. Down climb easy slab to a couple of boulders. There is a single bolt underneath the smaller boulder on your right\u00a0(looking down the canyon). You can use it to do your first rappel, or if feeling comfortable, down climb this section (there are a few climbing moves just below the sandy floor).\u00a0Walk just a little down canyon and there is immediately 2nd rappel. I had to look a little for anchors. I followed the watercourse and saw rope lines in the sandstone suggesting that previous route went straight down here and the route was rappelled from a boulder above. Do not use this boulder. There was also an obvious place with bolt, which was removed. Good anchors are above this and accessible from above - left side of the canyon. Walk slightly back and around large boulders to easily access this new 2 bolt anchor with webbing.\u00a0\nContinue downwards and canyon soon opens with amazing views of Park Avenue. Veer down and then left (small trail visible) to find anchors for your 3rd rappel. We found anchor on a large boulder as seen on the photo below (green sling). Again, this is very low angle rappel and could be down climbed.\u00a0\nFollow a small trail down and then again left for the last and the only interesting rappel. You have two options here - we first found a rappel down into a corner from a sling and used this one. Once down, we waited for the 2nd party coming after us, and they used a different rappel.\u00a0\nRappel 1: easier, from a sling boulder with blue webbing, only about 20 meters long. Slightly awkward to drop into it, but much easier rap once inside the corner/groove.Rappel 2: located more on the right side (looking down the canyon right) from 2 bolts next to a large boulder. This rappel is longer and steeper, 70 meter rope required for this one (at least the party used 70 meter rope and did not have much left, possibly 60 may be enough with some rope extension during rappel).\u00a0\nOnce done with rappels, follow cliff walls on your right trying to stay either on trail and later mostly on slick rock. Soon you will see people hiking Park Avenue trail. Stay on a slick rock bench and this will eventually bring you to the start of the Park Avenue Trail and parking lot.

With this erosion still occurring, the canyon is continually becoming deeper over time.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nApproximately 15,000 years ago, Idaho\u2019s Lake Bonneville had a spillover that resulted in a massive volume of water rushing through Hells Canyon. Although this event did not make the canyon deeper it did increase the overall width and shape of the rims, forming large flat terraces throughout the gorge.\r\n\u00a0Ancient Pictographs\r\nNative Americans were the first humans to settle in Hells Canyon. For many years the canyon provided a passageway and temporary home for the Nez Perce tribe, most notably, but also the Shoshone-Bannock, Northern Paiute, and Cayute tribes. Evidence of these original settlers is still found in Hells Canyon today, thanks to pictographs and petroglyphs left behind at various locations along the river and canyon walls. Originally used as markers for river crossings, settlements, and routes, today the pictographs and petroglyphs symbolize the long rich history of these original canyon visitors.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, several members of the Lewis & Clark Expedition briefly entered Hells Canyon but chose to turn back and head another direction. Then, in 1811, Wilson Price Hunt, following journals left by the Lewis & Clark Expedition, attempted leading the Astor Expedition into the canyon in hopes of finding the quickest route northward. The group was unsuccessful, forced to find other routes and travel methods after encountering harsh rapids that capsized their canoes and eliminated much of their food & supplies.\r\n\r\nMiners became the next settlers in Hells Canyon, discovering gold along the riverbanks during the 1860s. However, the mining boom was shortlived and mostly unprofitable, causing the canyon to be deserted of most settlers again. Then, in the 1880s, farmers and ranchers began moving to the area but most only briefly stayed because of the unpredictable harsh weather and environment within the canyon area. Only a few ranches were able to persevere until today. Kirkwood Historical Ranch, an abandoned ranch which was once the home of former Idaho Governor Len Jordan, has been established as a major interpretitive location within Hells Canyon. Accessed only by boat or trail, the site contains 7100-year old archaeological evidence of early human settlement as well as a more recent homestead and ranch to explore.\r\n\u00a0Kirkwood Historical Ranch\r\nIn 1975, Congress created the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (HCNRA). The HCNRA is comprised of 652,488 acres within Oregon and Idaho, including nearly 215,000 acres established as a Wilderness Area (named \u201cHells Canyon Wilderness\u201d) and three rivers (Snake, Imnaha, and Rapid) having sections designated as \u201cWild & Scenic\u201d. No new roads, homesteads, or ranches will be built ever again in the HCNRA, although the few existing ranches at the time of the HCNRA designation were grandfathered-in and allowed continued operation.

It's relatively deep, ranging from just a few hundred to well over one thousand feet in depth, and moderately narrow. It is cut by one major tributary, the Broad River.\r\n\r\nThe lower section of the gorge was dammed many years ago to form Lake Lure, widely considered to be one of the prettiest man-made lakes in North America. Since the lake is almost cupped by the escarpment walls of solid granite that form the tail of the gorge, it is undeniably a strikingly scenic location. The real estate around the lake is some of the most expensive in the state, and hardly a square foot of it remains undeveloped. Houses stand in close proximity to one another, and there is almost no public access to the lake itself. And no slope, no matter how steep, seems to be free of a house of some type as long as that land is waterfront. It is both a horrifying and humorous sight.\r\n\r\nAn inn on Lake Lure.\r\n\r\nThe gorge itself is also heavily developed, with two communities lying deep within it: Lake Lure, and Bat Cave. All along the gorge are inns, shops, two post offices, restaurants, private campgrounds, one amusement park (Chimney Rock Park), and uncounted thousands of vacation homes with accompanying driveways and roads being endlessly cut through the forests and gouged into the slopes of the gorge and onto the ridgelines.\r\n\r\nHowever, all is not lost.\r\n\r\nThere is something like a wilderness aspect of the land still to be found in a couple of places within Hickory Nut Gorge. With the help of the Nature Conservancy, the State of North Carolina has managed to procure the ownership and/or conservation easements of just under 3,000 acres of land on either side of the gorge just above Lake Lure. Chimney Rock Park has been purchased by the state, and a good portion of both Rumbling Bald Mountain and Shumont Mountain are now in the hands of the state and will all be a part of the new park, due to be open to the public in 2008.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are no facilities at all within the lands to be incorporated into the park boundaries, but one is allowed to hike there, and Rumbling Bald has become the single most popular rock climbing location in the entire state (if not the entire Southeast). On any given day of nice weather, be prepared to share the climbing routes on Rumbling Bald with dozens of other rock climbers.\r\n\r\nRock climbing inside Rumbling Bald Mountain.\r\n\r\nThe forests of Hickory Nut Gorge are typical of the southern Appalachians.

The view of the peak soaring above the Canyon Creek Lakes is one not easily left behind.  It is possible to climb the peak from Canyon Creek, although access is much better from Grizzly Lake.  \r\n\r\nMount Hilton (8,964):\r\n\r\nLooming above the Boulder Creek Lakes basin, Mount Hilton is the dominant peak above the cirque.  The second highest summit in the Trinities, it sees far fewer climbers than Thompson.  Access is from the Boulder Creek Lakes.  No established routes exist, although the nearly the entire route is visible from the lakes, since there is little tree cover and it generally climbs naked granite.\r\n\r\nSawtooth Peak (8,886):\r\n\r\nThe jagged summit is visible from numerous places inside Canyon Creek, but the peak rises so sharply from the canyon floor it is difficult to discern its immensity from most locations.  The best place to gain an appreciation of Sawtooth Peak is from the Boulder Creek Lakes basin.  From this location it is possible to see the peak rising dramatically from the bottom of Canyon Creek with impressive vertical relief.  The summit can be reached from Smith Lake, which sits astride the ridge separating Canyon Creek from the Stuart Fork of the Trinity River.  Smith Lake can be reached from either drainage, although the best route is from Alpine Lake.  Alpine Lake is accessed via the Stuart Fork trail or the Bear Creek Trail, which leaves from the Canyon Creek Trailhead.\r\n\r\nWedding Cake (8,569):  \r\n\r\nWedding Cake is situated just below Thompson Peak, on the ridge separating the Grizzly Creek drainage from the Canyon Creek drainage.  The peak is a sharp pinnacle of granite, jutting up dramatically from the ridgeline.  Although 450 feet shorter than Thompson Peak, the two summits appear to be twins from the Canyon Creek Lakes basin.  Wedding Cake is accessed along the same lines as Thompson Peak.\r\n\u00a0Upper Rush Creek Lake from Monument Peak\r\nMonument Peak (7,771):\r\n\r\nMonument Peak anchors the southern stretch of Canyon Creek.  The mountain is essentially a massive granite ridgeline with a prominent summit knob.  It is one of the few high peaks of the Trinity Alps visible from Weaverville.  Monument Peak is not part of the core of the Canyon Creek area but it deserves inclusion since it towers high above the creek and is briefly visible from the road leading to the trailhead.  The best place to observe the spectacular north wall is from the high peaks in the Red Trinity Alps, especially Red Mountain, or from the Stoney Ridge trail.  Two lake basins are found nestled in Monument Peak.  Beautiful East Fork Lake is accessed from Canyon Creek and sees minimal use.  The four Rush Creek Lakes are found in an incredible granite cirque directly beneath the summit.  These lakes are accessed by two different routes, both of which originate on the east side of the mountain and therefore are not part of the Canyon Creek drainage.  The summit is an off trail scramble, but is one of the more accessible peaks in the Trinity Alps.  Monument Peak also has what may be the best view in northern California.  From the summit the canyon of Canyon Creek is so close one can almost reach out and touch it.  The Green Trinities, Stuart Fork of the Trinity River, the Red Trinities, Mt. Shasta, Crater Peak, Lassen Peak, Brokeoff Mountain, the northern Sierra Nevada and the North Coast Range are all visible.\r\n\r\nUnnamed Peaks\r\n\r\nNumerous unnamed peaks, several over 8,000 feet, are located along Canyon Creek.

Ask people about the \u00a0Middle Canyon Creek FallsKlamath Mountains and you are likely to get a blank stare.  The Siskiyous are well known in southern Oregon and a few people are familiar with the Trinity Alps, but the Klamaths are practically unknown to the general public.  Stretching from the North Yolla Bolly Mountains, west of Red Bluff in California, to the Kalmiopsis region of the Siskiyous in southern Oregon, the Klamaths comprise a massive uplift of several million acres, with numerous subranges including the Trinity Alps, the North Yolla Bollys, the Marble Mountains, the Russian Range, the Eddy Range, the Red Buttes, and the Siskyous.  The composition of the mountains is a m\u00e9lange of rock types ranging from granite to marble to serpentine.  Draining these ranges are the fantastic Trinity, Salmon and Klamath Rivers, all classic mountain drainages.  Numerous other substantial waterways also flow through the Klamath Mountains.\r\n\r\nAside from Mount Eddy, the Trinity Alps are the highest range in the Klamath Mountains.  The Trinities themselves can be divided into three distinct regions.  In the west are the vast Green Trinities.  This area is composed of steep canyons, roaring rivers, sharp ridgelines, and utter solitude.  The \"green\" appellation is derived from the vast stands of virgin timber found in this area.  In the east, rising above Trinity Lake, are the Red Trinities.  The name comes from the color of the serpentine that composes most of the mountains in this section.  Numerous excellent peaks over 8,000 feet as well as an enviable number of lake basins are found in the Red Trinities.  Sandwiched between these two attractive regions is the heart of the Trinity Alps, the White Trinities.  So-called because of the stark, white granite found in this area, this is the home of the range's highest peaks, largest lakes and most spectacular mountain scenery.  It is because of this region that the Trinity Mountains are justly elevated to the Trinity Alps.  \r\n\r\nCanyon Creek cuts into the heart of the White Trinities.  Its headwaters are found in the Canyon Creek Lakes.  It flows nearly twenty miles to the south before it joins the Trinity River at Junction City.  Although the creek flows through an impressive canyon for its entire duration, the Canyon itself legitimately begins at the confluence of Canyon and Bear Creeks.  The road into the canyon ends a short distance from this point, where the trailhead is located.  The Canyon itself can be divided into two parts, Upper and Lower Canyon Creek.  The Lower section is a steep, V-shaped canyon.  Access to the creek can be difficult in sections.  McCay Camp, a large island in the creek, provides the best route to the creek in the lower canyon.  The Sinks, a stretch of creek that runs underground when water levels are low, are also nearby.  The Upper Canyon is a classic U-shaped glacial canyon with sheer walls and a broad flat floor.  Access to the creek is easy in this section and it is here that the high peaks and granite cliffs are most spectacular.  \r\n\r\nFour named peaks crown Canyon Creek, all of which are excellent climbing destinations.  Thompson Peak, the second highest summit in the Klamath Mountains (after Mount Eddy), sits regally at the northern end of the canyon, forming an impressive backdrop to the Canyon Creek Lakes.  Just below Thompson Peak sits the oddly named Wedding Cake, another impressive peak.  Mt. Hilton, the second highest peak in the Trinities, towers above the Boulder Creek Lakes, an area that also provides the best views of Sawtooth Peak.  As noted previously, several other 8,000-plus and 7,000-plus peaks are found along Canyon Creek. \r\n", "Overview": "\n            Soaring, jagged summits tower over icy lakes in glacier polished granite cirques.  Placid, azure creeks erupt into thunderous waterfalls.  While this may bring the Sierra Nevada to mind, it describes the Trinity Alps's Canyon Creek.  The core of the Trinity Alps is California\u2019s other, lesser known but equally spectacular granite wonderland.  Cutting into the heart of the Trinities, Canyon Creek brings all the best the Trinities have to offer in one easily accessible package.  As one can surmise, the scenic bounty has not gone under the radar and it is far and away the most popular destination in the Trinity Alps.  Nonetheless, crowds are still relatively light when compared to many parts of the Sierra.  For those who desire solitude, it is still easily acquired in this spectacular mountain landscape.\u00a0Sawtooth Peak from the Boulder Creek Lakes basin\r\n\r\nCanyon Creek ranges from 3,000 to 4,000 feet in depth.  Four named summits over 8,500 feet tower above the canyon.  Numerous other 8,000-plus and 7,000-plus peaks line the ridges.  Three lake basins are located within the Canyon Creek drainage.  Moreover, Canyon Creek itself drains the canyon.  This creek is the real deal, a thunderous, torrential mountain river.  Canyon Creek plunges over four waterfalls that even the Sierra would be proud to claim.  Several other falls are located on feeder creeks, notably Boulder Creek.  A seemingly limitless number of cascades pour down the walls of Canyon Creek.  Throw in fantastic old growth forests, lush meadows and enormous granite boulders to flesh out the classic mountain dreamland.\r\n\r\nHiking and backpacking are definitely the most popular activity in Canyon Creek.  The various Canyon Creek falls and the Canyon Creek Lakes are the most popular destinations in Canyon Creek.  For those wishing to ditch the crowds, the Boulder Creek Lakes basin is the best destination.  Although climbing is not nearly as popular in Canyon Creek, the possibilities for fantastic climbs on excellent granite are virtually unlimited.  Most climbing takes place when summiting the peaks, but climbers have been spotted in other parts of the Canyon, especially in the Boulder Creek Lakes area.\r\n\r\n", "Lakes": "\u00a0Lower Canyon Creek Lake\u00a0Sawtooth Peak viewed from Boulder Creek Lake\r\nThree lake basins are found in the Trinity Alps. \r\n\r\nCanyon Creek Lakes:\r\n\r\nThe Canyon Creek Lakes are the most popular destination in the Trinity Alps.  When standing on the shores of the lakes, taking in the Wedding Cake and Thompson Peak, with Sawtooth Peak towering overhead, the thunder of outlet falls and numerous cascades pouring into the lakes and granite cliffs rising up all around, it is easy understand the attraction.  Factor in a relatively easy 8-mile hike from the trailhead, and the popularity of the Canyon Creek Lakes is ensured.  Even so, crowds are small relative to many parts of the Sierra.  Lower Canyon Creek Lake is 14 acres and sits at 5,600 feet.  Upper Canyon Creek Lake is 25 acres and sits spectacularly at 6,000 feet.  The views of Thompson Peak and Wedding Cake are spectacular.  While the lower lake is entirely within a granite bowl, the upper lake does have a nice meadow on its north side.  Adjacent to the meadow are sheer granite cliffs several hundred feet high plunging directly into the water.  \r\n\r\nTwo more lakes are situated above the Canyon Creek Lakes.  El Lake is located in the upper drainage northeast of Upper Canyon Creek Lake.  No official trail leads to the lake, but it is an easy off trail trip up to 7,000', where the lake is nestled into a small cirque below Sawtooth Peak.  Kalmia Lake is on a shelf above the headwaters of Canyon Creek, northwest of Upper Canyon Creek Lake.  Access is difficult and follows a gully northwest of El Lake.  \r\n\r\nBoulder Creek Lakes:\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of Canyon Creek may be awash with backpackers, the Boulder Creek Lakes are an isolated, empty and absolutely spectacular destination.  The lakes are situated in a granite bowl with numerous small tarns surrounding the lakes.  Two impressive outlet falls drain the lakes; one cascades into the main branch of Boulder Creek while the other plunges over the western rim of the basin in a dramatic freefall several hundred feet high.  Numerous cascades feed the lakes.  Mount Hilton is accessible up the granite cliffs north of the lakes.  The best views of Sawtooth Peak are found here.  To reach the Boulder Creek Lakes, Canyon Creek must be forded just above the Middle Canyon Creek Falls.  From there it is two miles to the lakes, and nearly 800 feet elevation gain, which comes all at once.\r\n\r\nForbidden Lakes:\r\n\r\nThese are often considered part of the Boulder Creek Lakes group, but they are sufficiently higher and isolated to be considered a separate lakes basin.  Situated in a narrow cirque, the forbidding name of the lakes is appropriate, given their hidden nature.  From the Boulder Creek Lakes, it is possible to discern the location of the cirque, but one can be forgiven for not thinking lakes were located there.  To reach them, simply follow the ridge on the northwest side of Boulder Creek Lakes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=40.96849&amp;distance_lon_9=-123.02353&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.96849\u00b0N/123.02353\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "May23,2007/Feb10,2009", "Waterfalls": "\u00a0The Canyon Creek Falls\u00a0Boulder Creek Cascades\r\n\r\nOne of the best features of Canyon Creek is the waterfalls.  There are four primary falls with numerous smaller falls and cascades.  \r\n\r\nThe first fall on Canyon Creek forms the dividing line between the upper and lower canyon.  This is THE Canyon Creek Falls.  The trail used to pass near the base of the falls but the Forest Service rerouted it above the falls.  Now the route offers only fleeting and partially obscured views of the massive waterfall.  For those willing to do a little bushwhacking and are observant enough to find the route, it is possible to climb down to the base.  The views are spectacular and the volume of water is daunting.  In the past, when the trail passed by the falls, it was referred to as Lower Canyon Creek Falls.  Once the trail was rerouted the waterfall fell into relative obscurity and the name was mistakenly applied to a significant cataract just above the real falls.  The misnamed cataract is visible where the trail rejoins the Canyon Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Canyon Creek Falls is the most impressive falls visible from the Canyon Creek Trail.  The trail itself veers away from the falls leaving it partially obscured by trees, but a use trail leads to its base.  It is possible to climb over the granite to the top and then rejoin the trail at the Boulder Creek Lakes trail ford.  The falls is wide, with three channels pouring over the granite rim before rejoining in a swirling pool and pouring through another narrow slot.  \r\n\r\nUpper Canyon Creek Falls is located just beneath the outlet of Lower Canyon Creek Lake.  A striking granite pinnacle can be seen high above the falls.  The outlet of Lower Canyon Creek Lake also forms an impressive Cascade.  The main channel tumbles down a narrow slot while numerous side channels funnel the water over a series of chutes and cataracts.\r\n\r\nSeveral cascades fall down the sides of Canyon Creek.  One of the best is located on the west slope of the Lower Canyon.  It is best visible when the trail (which is on the east side of Canyon Creek) passes a small meadow.  Other cascades are seen throughout the canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Boulder Creek Lakes basin has numerous cascades and falls.  The outlet falls of the lakes are impressive as are the falls at the convergence of the creek from Forbidden Lakes and the cascades coming off Mount Hilton.\r\n\r\n", "History": "\u00a0Canyon Creek from the Boulder Lakes\r\nThe Wintun Indians originally settled the Trinity Alps region.  In the early nineteenth century American explorers began to encroach.  The famous mountain man Jedidiah Smith passed through the region during his traverse of the western coast of North America.  A few years later The Reading Expedition explored the region.  Major Reading incorrectly thought the Trinity River flowed to Trinidad on the coast, thus giving the river its name.  In truth, the river flows into the Klamath River near the present day Yurok Indian Reservation.  \r\n\r\nGold was discovered in 1848 and hordes of prospectors soon poured into the region.  Weaverville sprang up quickly and was soon the base of operations for gold miners.  Settlements were established deep in what is now the Trinity Alps Wilderness.  Evidence of this history can be found in many places, including Canyon Creek.  McCay Camp was originally a miner\u2019s camp.  In the upper canyon, just below the outlet falls of Lower Canyon Creek Lake, several large iron pipes can be seen in the creek.  These are the remains of the nineteenth century Stonehouse mining operation.  Even greater evidence of this past can be found in other parts of the Trinity Alps, such as Papoose Lake.  \r\n\r\nLogging began late in the area.  Consequently, most of the Trinity Alps consist of virgin timber.  This is particularly dramatic in the Green Trinities, but Canyon Creek also boasts some enormous old growth trees.  Logging in the Trinity Alps was permanently prohibited when the area was designated the Salmon-Trinity Alps Primitive Area.  It was designated wilderness by the 1984 California Wilderness Act.  \r\n", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall", "Red Tape": "\u00a0Boulder Creek Lake inlet falls\r\n\r\nCanyon Creek is located in the Trinity Alps Wilderness.

It is estimated that people have been living here for over 1,500 years and to this day it still sustains a community of Navajo People who are intimately connected to their landscape.  And what a landscape it is!  There are over 2,700 archaeological sites in the beautiful canyon that was carved through sandstone by the Rio de Chelly.  The canyon at its shallowest is 30 feet deep but at its deepest is about 1,000 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe canyon is on Navajo land and is managed jointly by the tribe and the National Park Service as Canyon de Chelly National Monument which was established in 1931 and encompasses 83,840 acres.  As a result there are some restrictions that usually aren't in place in other National Park Service areas.  For instance, you must be accompanied by a Park Ranger or Navajo Guide when you enter the canyon on all trails except the White House Ruin Trail.

The canyon\u2019s creation began around the same time as the Grand Canyon in the U.S.\u00a0by a crack in the area\u2019s crust and erosion by the Grijalva River, which still runs through it. The canyon has vertical walls which reach as high as 1000 meters, with the river turning up to ninety degrees during the thirteen kilometers that the narrow passage runs. At the north end of the canyon is the Chicoas\u00e9n Dam, one of several on the Grijalva River and important for water storage and the generation of hydroelectricity. Surrounding the canyon is the\u00a0Sumidero Canyon National Park, which extends for 21,789 hectares over four municipalities of the state of Chiapas. This park is administered by the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de \u00c1reas Naturales Protegidas (Conanp). Most of the vegetation of this park is low to medium heightdeciduous rainforest, with small areas of pine/oak trees and grassland.\nThe canyon/park is the second most important tourist site in Chiapas, drawing mostly Mexican visitors who see the canyon by boats which leave from Chiapa de Corzo. The park borders Tuxtla Guti\u00e9rrez, the state\u2019s largest city, which has caused problems with human encroachment and settlement on park land. More importantly, the urban areas and logging areas upstream from the canyon have caused serious pollution problems, with up to 5000 tons of solid waste extracted from the Grijalva River each year. This waste tend to build up in the canyon because of its narrowness, the convergence of water flows and the presence of the Chicoas\u00e9n Dam.After you've visited the canyon but boat from Chiapa de Corzo, you can see the canyon from above, from five viewpoints. To get there take the road behind the museum of anthropology. You can take collectivo route 69 from here on the corner.

It's a hundred yards or so, across the dry creekbed.  Camping is free, and no permits are necessary, but there are absolutely no open fires permitted in Rock Canyon due to year round fire hazard. There are potentially many more camping areas, but this one seems to be the most established. ", "Overview": "\n            Rock Canyon is a regular cornucopia of outdoor activity. This canyon literally spills out into the bench neighborhoods of Provo Utah.  Hiking, mountain biking, and all sorts of climbing abound in this stone sanctuary.  Primarily quartzite and limestone, this canyon provides a ton of potential for future climbing on its seemingly endless rock.  With routes already numbering in the hundreds, Rock Canyon certainly will yield many more as its popularity continues to grow.\r\n\r\nA huge number of popular routes exist within ten minutes walking distance of the parking area at the mouth of the canyon.  The \"Red Slab\" is the first area to be encountered.  A popular destination for beginners and experienced climbers alike, Red Slab has something for everyone, with routes ranging from 5.6 to 5.10.  Well Bolted, this is an ideal location for beginning lead climbers to get the feel of clipping protection, while not having to worry too much about the difficulty of the terrain.\u00a0The Red Slab is identifiable by its distinctly reddish color.  Ed and Terry is directly behind and above Red Slab.  Both are visible in this picture.\r\n\r\nDirectly behind Red Slab is \"Ed and Terry Wall.\"  This is the second largest rock outcrop in the entire canyon and is said to have a very high concentration of extremely good routes.  Some are bolted, and others are not, so bring your rack, and have some fun.  Lines range from 5.7 to 5.12c/d.  The approach is the same as Red Slab just keep working your way up behind it.  It takes about five minutes longer, but the added time is enough to thin out the concentration of climbers looking for something fast and easy.\r\n\r\nAlmost directly across the canyon to the north is \"Superbowl Wall.\" most the current routes on Superbowl are very overhung, and lie within the 5.11-12a range.  This is due to a huge roof that bisects every route with the exception of one on the right. Everything is bolted so bring your draws.\r\n\r\nIf you continue past this first area a mere two minutes to an old metal gate on the road, you come to one of the most popular locations in the canyon, \"The Kitchen.\"  Short and Juggy, The Kitchen is where many in Utah climb for their very first time. The KitchenChain anchors at the top allow you to toprope several routes in the kitchen alcove, and  others let you lead or toprope several more lines around the corner to the east past the gate.  The kitchen is a fantastic place to learn lots of different trad and sport fundamentals, without having to be too scared while doing it. You'll need to know how lieback, jam and crimp in order to conquer this climber's playground. Many cracks and crevices allow for perfect practice of placing various types of protection from the safety of the deck.  Bring your harness and a sling and try out that new gear you just bought at Mountainworks (right down the street).  Routes ranging 5.6 (in the right corner) to 5.10d (right face, run out two bolt lead)  A word of advice: Don't be impatient if you want to climb here.  Due to its popularity, the kitchen almost always has someone on it. If you're already climbing, try to be courteous, and let everyone have a go.\r\n\r\nDirectly to the right of the Kitchen there is a trail that works its way up some steep scree to a few other very popular walls in the area. The Green Monster is a very obvious, very tall slab with a perfect hand crack toward its right side.  Good for top roping or trad,  this crack is a 5.9, but if you are going to lead it, be sure you have a few #3-#4 camalots.  Not much fixed protection anywhere on this wall keeps traffic down, but the climbing is excellent and tons of fun nonetheless.  \u00a0The Green Monster Wall.  It's deceptively high. The top of Tinkertoy wall is barely visible to the right and below Green Monster \r\n\r\n\u00a0Trail leading to the Green Monster/Tinkertoys areaJust past the Green Monster, a little farther up the trail is the Tinkertoys Wall.  Every bit as much fun as its name implies, \"Tinkertoys\" has four or five great straghtforward lines over an easy ledge, and up to chains at the top.  Substantially shorter than Green Monster, This wall still has enough height to keep things interesting. \r\n\r\nImmediately past The Kitchen is the George Wall.  Identifiable by its large overhang just off the ground, George is just a few feet up and on the right.  It's slightly more broken that The Kitchen rock, and is less easily accessable, therefore it is less crowded. \r\n\r\nBeyond this cluster of locations, the climbing starts to get really interesting.  The geology shifts from quartzite to limestone, and many of the clasic routes are found thereafter. With too many locations and routes to list, If you want to really know Rock Canyon, pick up a local climber's guide and just go exploring.  There's a lifetime worth routes up there. \r\n         ", "Created/Edited": "Sep18,2006/Jul19,2009", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=40.26459&amp;distance_lon_9=-111.62985&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.26459\u00b0N/111.62985\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Absolutely no red tape here, Just go and climb.", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

There is only one scramble route down so you must find it; it's near the base of a series of red Carmel hills. The scramble drops around 80 feet and once in the canyon, head right (downstream) and quickly enter a short narrows that offer easy scrambling. The canyon turns south and you will quickly encounter an 8 meter drop. This is the only rappel in the canyon, and since it's only a few minutes away from the car, the easiest thing to do is to set your rope and leave it while you finish the canyon. One person from your group can then run back and grab it when you return to the car.\nHiking into Buck Canyon from the TH\nUpper part of the west fork\nAlthough it's an 8 meter drop, the only rappel anchor is a couple large rocks above and to the right side of the canyon (LDC). Scramble about 30 feet up the slickrock to locate the long slings wrapped around the rocks. If you have a 30 meter rope you can do a single strand rappel by tying the end of the rope into the anchor, or you can made a double strand rappel id you have a 50 or 60 meter rope. Note that the rappel is 26 meters long from the anchor to the ground below the dryfall. At least 30 meters of rope is required!Once past this only rappel, continue down the now narrow slot and scramble through various narrows and reach a 10 foot drop that you can carefully down climb. Beginners may want a hand here but it's not too bad. Beyond that much of the canyon is a nice hike, with one more difficulty in the form of a narrow squeeze. Here you can just slide down the slot (jeans and long sleeves may help prevent scraping your skin). About two miles from the car you will reach a large opening and a side canyon coming in from the right (west). This side canyon can be used as a good exit where a short scramble northward brings you back to the rim where you can walk along the open desert to your car. This is only recommended if you're short on time or the weather is turning bad. If you have the time, continue south down the wide open canyon, through various tall grass and bushes at this point (and possible standing water) until you can see the east fork of Buck Canyon coming in from the left. Turn left and begin heading up this drainage. There will be some bushwhacking you will likely have to contend with, but a few minutes after starting up the east fork, you will see a large natural arch off to the left. This beautiful arch has maybe a 100 foot span and can easily be scrambled up.\nThe lone rappel in Buck Canyon\n\nStarting down the 10 foot drop in Buck Canyon\n\nTrees at the end of narrows\nWorking through Buck Canyon\n\nThe squeeze section in Buck Canyon\n\nLooking down the east fork of Buck Canyon\nBuck Canyon narrows\n\nBuck Canyon Narrows\n\nUnnamed arch in Buck Canyon\nAnother 20 minutes of hiking up the east fork you'll run into Buck Canyon Arch; a large natural bridge. Scrambling into the circular opening makes for a great photo opportunity. A half-mile past Buck Canyon Arch the canyon bottom will end at a 20 meter dryfall that cannot be ascended. Locate a large sandy slope to the right of the dryfall and hike steeply up loose sand. At the top you can descend a few feet to re-gain the sandy wash. The rest of the hike up the east fork is straightforward, and you will reach a small side drainage to the left, a mile or so beyond the dryfall bypass trail. Hike up this drainage and scramble easily to the north and emerge on the rim. Once you reach the open desert, it's another 0.8 mile northward to the upper end of the west fork. There is a small drainage you must cross about halfway back to the car where cattle appear to hang out. To get back to the north rim of the west fork, locate a cairn marking the steep, loose scramble down. Be careful here as refrigerator sized rocks were moving underfoot. Have someone retreive your rope and scramble up 80 feet to your car.\nBuck Canyon Arch\nHiking up the east fork of Buck Canyon\nNearing the rim above the east fork\n", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

On thisstretch of the Arkansas River, you'll passrapids named \"Widowmaker,\" \"Raft Ripper\" and \"TheGraveyard.\" The imaginative river rat likes to think there is a story behindeach name.But \"Canyon Doors\" is simply that, two rectangularrocks on either side that welcome a boater into the 20-mile stretch known as Browns Canyon.It's the gateway to the most popular whitewater run on the nation's second-mostrafted river.It used to be the nation's most rafted river, but the Ocoee Riverin Tennessee recently surpassed the Arkansas. That's one ofthe reasons we're here, on a brisk May morning on an ice-cold river starting toswell with snowmelt. Environmentalists, rafting guides and others have pinedfor a federal designation to protect the area permanently and to create alandmark to draw more visitors.After several failed attempts to make Browns Canyona wilderness, they now are pinning hopes on a proposal by U.S. Sen. Mark Udall,D-Colorado, to create a national monument.\"People have forgotten how pretty Browns Canyon is andhow good it is,\" says our rafting guide Bill Dvorak, who at 63 has beenleading trips down the river longer than anyone else in the Arkansas Valley.\"One of the things a national monument would do is to get thatrecognition, get that star on the map.\"The proposal has changed, but many of the old hurdlesremain. Off-highway-vehicle users are opposed. U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, aColorado Springs Republican whose district includes this stretch of the valley,is not convinced. Partisan gridlock in Washingtoncould mean a path for legislation as rocky as the river itself.Dvorak has invited me on this journey to let the river dothe talking, to experience firsthand what makes Browns Canyona unique and beautiful trip, and why he says it would make an ideal nationalmonument.* * *The Arkansas begins withmelting snow in the mountains around Leadville and runs parallel with U.S.Highway 24 through Buena Vista before leavingthe highway and disappearing in scrubby, dry foothills.The source of the name \"Brown\" is murky. MaybeBrown was a person or maybe that was the railroad workers' remark on the colorof the rocks, with an \"s\" added by some map-maker over the years.The railroad no longer is used, but humans' impact on thearea is on the increase. As we float down the gentle prelude to the canyon,Dvorak points to new houses on the river banks and areas now closed off toboaters. We pass Rainbow Rock, where he used to take people rock climbing untilit was sold and new owners shooed them off.We pass an old fish hatchery where Nestle Waters is drawingspring water to sell in plastic bottles. We pass Ruby Mountain,where rock hounds have been collecting garnet and topaz for a century.Browns Canyon is a more mellowtrip than some other whitewater runs in the area, where guides take boaterswhen the flow is too high at the more difficult run The Numbers. The scenery isas big a draw as the adrenaline rush, and numerous backcountry campsites linethe river.That does not, we are soon to find out, mean we will staydry.* * *\"This is 'Pinball' rapid. The ball is yellow. Theobject is not to score points.\"That's Dvorak's warning as he maneuvers us through gapsbarely wider than our yellow raft, past boulders the size of houses thattumbled into the river from the cliffs above. Entering the canyon, the rivergets loud and the wind blasts in your ears. You feel far from civilization.More than 30 years ago, the U.S. Bureau of Land Managementdesignated the area a wilderness study area, meaning it has wildernessqualities and the same prohibitions on vehicle use but that its status istemporary and could be altered by Congress.These wilderness qualities are in full view in the placidstretches between rapids. High canyon walls and desolate, scrubby bluffs toweroverhead. There are about nine miles of trails in the wilderness study area,but the vast majority of people experience Browns Canyonas we are, by boat.We pummel through the rapid known as \"Zoom Flume,\"laughing as a wave of water hits us like a brutally cold slap in the face. Weslide past Hemorrhoid Rock. Says Dvorak, \"If you don't make the curve, youget the rock right where you don't want it.\"After about 2.5 hours on the river, Dvorak guides us to thetake-out spot. It's a run Dvorak has done countless times, but it still puts asmile on his face.\"That's the great thing about the river. Every time youcome down, it's different,\" he says.It remains to be seen if the latest effort at federaldesignation will be any different.* * *\"We've just been down the river so you've seen theunique beauty it has, but for me it's the uniqueness of the ecosystem,\"says Keith Baker, executive director of the Friends of Browns Canyon, whojoined us on our trip.\"Especially in Colorado,we have lots of wilderness that is at alpine or sub-alpine levels, but we don'thave anything that is at a low elevation like that, with a river throughit,\" he says.It's the same argument supporters have made since the early1990s and the group has made since forming in 2003. In 2005, it nearly worked.Then-U.S. Rep. Joel Hefley, a Colorado Springs Republican,was an enthusiastic supporter of making it a wilderness, and it nearly came toa vote until the National Rifle Association came out against it, saying theclosure of a four-wheel-drive road would hinder access for older hunters. Themeasure died, as did a similar bill introduced in 2008 by then-U.S. Sen. KenSalazar, D-Colorado.Hefley retired in 2006 and Lamborn, his successor, was coolto the idea of a wilderness and is uncertain about the national monumentproposal. After attending a public meeting in April, he told constituents in anewsletter, \"I would like to see greater consensus from the communitybefore supporting such a dramatic change. Such a designation could lead toincreased federal regulations on the land and further restrict its use.\"Lamborn spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen said last week thecongressman \"is studying the proposal at this time and neither supportsnor rejects it outright.\"Udall's office stresses public access would not be limitedunder his proposal. Turret Trail, the road of contention in earlier efforts,would remain open to vehicles and mountain biking trails would remain open,though little biking is done in the rugged area. The 22,000-acre nationalmonument would be managed as it is now, by the BLM, U.S. Forest Service and Colorado Parks and Wildlife. About half of theland would be wilderness, where no new roads or biking trails could be built.Camping still would be allowed along the river and rafting would not be moreregulated.Dvorak acknowledges outfitters have a financial incentive todraw more people to a national monument.\"Areas that are near permanently protected publiclands, the per capita income goes up, the overall economy of the area goes upand obviously people who outfit in those areas are going to see an increase intheir business,\" he says. \"They buy food. They buy gas. They buy meals.They stay in motels. It's like a rising tide floats all ships.\"He hopes it can be a catalyst for the commercial raftingindustry here, which hasn't recovered from the 2002 Hayman fire. The Arkansas saw 252,213commercial user days in 2001 and 169,486 last year.Despite the long string of failures, Dvorak hopespersistence will pay off.\"I'm actually pretty optimistic. One way or another,we're going to get it done,\" he says.\nView from the Canyon.\nThe Collegiate Peaks \nBrowns Canyon\n ", "Location": "Colorado,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

{"Routes Overview": "There are several route possibilities available.  All routes require competency of at least 5.7 climbing.\r\n\r\nOld Route\r\n\r\nTo just see the main fork and return via the old route, see the Main Fork Route Page.  Briefly put (see the route page for more details):  From the trailhead, the route follows the old road until the drainage to the south is starts to deepen.  The route then follows the drainage until you reach the beginning of the slot. There are several downclimbs of up to 5.7 in difficulty and the slot gets better and better as you continue down canyon. The canyon is incredibly twisty and there are fantastic erosion features. You may get your feet wet in some pools. The highest rappel is 95 feet and is in the best section of the canyon. There are chockstones and logs wedged almost 100 feet above the canyon floor in the slot. When the canyon opens up and becomes very shallow, the route climbs north and back on to the old jeep road which is followed back to the car. There is about 1800 feet of elevation gain and the jeep trail is very steep, so expect a workout. Expect the route to take 6-9 hours depending on the experience of the group. \r\n\r\nOther Routes\r\n\r\nThere are several other alternate routes available.  The \"old route\" is the original route we took, but later we found that it was less effort to come in from Plug Hat Rock, especially if you want to see both forks.    You can also go down the \"Old Route\" and exit via Plug Hat. \r\n\r\nPlug Hat Exit Route\r\n\r\nIf a car shuttle is available you can do the slot and return via the Alternate Exit Route to Plug Hat Rock (see the route page for details).   This is less effort than hiking out to the \"Old Route\" trailhead.\r\n\r\nGrand Tour\r\n\r\nIf you're up to it and want more you can do both forks of Buckwater in one shot.  See the Grand Tour of Buckwater route page for more details.      This is highly recommended.\r\n\r\nYou can either do the \u201cold route\u201d down in and exit via Plug Hat Rock, or you can do the \"Grand Tour\" round trip from Plug Hat Rock.    This is now the recommended route and requires no car shuttle.     \r\n\r\nNote:  \r\n\r\nIf time is limited, I feel that the South Fork is the better of the two canyons (Main and South).

You will see the best sections of both canyons (both the Main and South Fork).     Unfortuantely, you will also miss the really nice rappel into the Magic Chamber, which is also worth doing if you have the time.\r\n\r\nThe best sections of the canyon system are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe South Fork Slot, the Magic Chamber, the deep section of the canyon after the confluence of the two forks, and the rap into the Magic Chamber.      \r\n\r\nWall detail in the lower canyon.\r\n", "When To Climb": "The Echo Park road opens in late April in most years.

a deep slot as the stream passes through the Navajo Sandstone.\u00a0 After a brief distance with several short climbs, there is a significant 10 foot or so step that might take some scrambling skills to pass.\u00a0 After this, the canyon bed ascends more gradually, briefly becoming less dramatic, and then entering a deep area of phenomenal beauty.\u00a0 Eventually, a small wash can be seen dropping in from the right (that followed on the loop hike) and after another 70 feet or so to the left, the canyon opens up.\r\n\r\nLower Cave:It is possible to climb up several hundred feet through quite spectacular canyon scenery until a steep slab is reached.\u00a0 When I was there, there was a knotted rope (that might or might not have held body weight) dangling down from an anchor above at this point.\u00a0 Any use of this or a similar rope would have to be at your own risk... Just beyond this point is a steeper wall, so most sources recommend stopping beneath the lower slab and descending out of the canyon.\u00a0At the exit to the canyon, there is a steep sandy slope climbing the hillside to the west with obvious foot travel upon it.\u00a0 To continue the canyon tour, climb this steep slope for 250 feet or so, keeping right and directly up the slope\u00a0until a use trail is\u00a0reached along with nice views of the vicinity.\u00a0\u00a0The trail turns\u00a0left\u00a0here and traverses along the top of the canyon in a south easterly direction for\u00a0about\u00a0250 feet where it crosses a sandy ridge.\u00a0 Follow the ridge south for 40 feet and then continue on the trail for a few hundred feet until it descends down into the wash.\u00a0 Be careful here, there is a lot of steep terrain.\u00a0 Carefully descend back into the Lower Red Cave.\u00a0 About 10 feet from the bottom, the downclimbing becomes dicey enough that you could either use a rope or make a short drop into the streambed.\u00a0 Exit back the way that you came here would be difficult, so if you are doing this, it is likely best to do the loop hike.Prior to continuing up the canyon, descend the watercourse downward to the top of the two drops mentioned above.\u00a0 Don't miss this part as it is really pretty!- You might want to bring a short length of rope to belay people, or lower people down the drop into the upper part of Lower Red Cave.\u00a0 In addition, descent of the Lower Red Cave would require a 120 or so foot rope, maybe a few anchors, or\u00a0luck that some really old and ratty in situ ropes don't break while you are weighting them.\r\n\r\nWash above the Upper Cave\r\nUpper Red CaveLoop Hike:From the point where you re-enter Lower Red Cave, once you have checked out the slot below, proceed up the canyon for about 0.4 miles, then climb the hillside on the left (north) side to exit out of the wash.\u00a0 It is also possible to leave the wash after about\u00a00.25 miles, climb past a rock with a small hole in it, and continue up the hill to a small summit.\u00a0 From the vicinity of this summit, or the saddle behind it (see map above), contour in a northerly direction to the west of a higher summit, eventually reaching a defined ATV trail.\u00a0 Either follow this for a bit north, or continue north past it, descending down into a pretty wash with smooth slickrock walls.\u00a0 There are a few points of scrambling here.\u00a0 Once in the streambed, follow this nice watercourse about 0.3 miles until Upper Red Cave is reached.\u00a0 At the junction, it is possible to set up a rappel and descend directly from this spot.\u00a0 It is likely easier to climb up an north about fifty feet to crest a ridge, then contour along the slope still in a northerly direction for another couple hundred feet and eventually drop west and down into the Upper Red Cave watercourse.\u00a0 Descend this back south a couple hundred feet to the junction and the\u00a0topmost reaches of Upper Red Cave.\u00a0Extra Credit:There is a cool looking red and then white rock dome just beyond the end of Upper Cave.\u00a0 I didn't do it, but and ascent from here would probably be a blast and give nice views of the area.\u00a0", "Red Tape": "- Although the canyons are\u00a0on public lands, you must cross private land to access it, so you should\u00a0get permission from the Tait family whose address is 2410 on Rt. 89.\u00a0 They are quite nice, and I had a long and pleasant conversation with one of the family members when I stopped by.\u00a0", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

Turn onto this road and ascend the switchbacks that yield increasingly spectacular views.  A little after three miles, turn right onto a dirt road signed for Upper Muley Twist Canyon.  If you have a low-clearance vehicle, park soon after this.\r\n\r\nWith high clearance, you can nearly five miles from what would be a hike of more than 14 miles.  The road is rough but not difficult for the next 2.4 miles to the parking area at the trailhead.\r\n\r\nAnother way to approach is from Boulder, along UT 12.  Follow the Burr Trail east from town.  The road is paved for 31 miles, sometimes steep and often winding, to the border of Capitol Reef National Park, and from there it becomes a 2wd dirt road. A little over two miles past the park boundary, look for the turnoff for Upper Muley Twist Canyon.", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\u00a0\r\nAn indisputable wonder, Upper Muley Twist Canyon is on many a hiker and guidebook's short list of the very best day hikes in Utah, where there is no shortage of spectacular day hikes.  The established route, which combines the canyon with a trek along the crest of the Waterpocket Fold above, is mostly a hike with a little bit of easy scrambling, but there are options for canyoneers and scramblers to go exploring.  One such possibility would be where the canyon route begins ascending to the rim in order to bypass the canyon's narrows.  The route eventually passes just above the very head of the canyon, but a canyoneer could opt for following the canyon itself to that point (the narrows are not long, and I do not know if they are technical).\r\n\r\nThe scenic highlights of the canyon are probably its eight sandstone arches, three along the rough access road to the trail itself and five further upcanyon, but the canyon walls and pinnacles within the canyon are worth attention, and the far-ranging views from atop the Fold complement and contrast the canyon scenery below.  Those far-ranging views include the length of the Henry Mountains, the last major range in the Lower 48 to be mapped and still quite remote by today's standards.\r\n\r\nThe name: \"From 1881 to 1884, the canyon served as a wagon route for Mormon pioneers traveling south toward San Juan County. The canyon was thought to be narrow enough to \u201ctwist a mule\u201d hence the name Muley Twist.\"\r\n\r\nSource\r\n\r\nFormerly, there was a page for this canyon, complete with a climber's log and about a few dozen photos, but the author deleted that page.  Attached to that page was this trip report that I wrote, and it contains numerous photographs as well as commentary on the route.

There are three arches to see.  The first, near the beginning, is Peek-a-boo Arch, practically a slit in the yellow sandstone.  Double Arch, which, as the name implies, has two spans, is next, and an unnamed one is third.  Peek-a-boo Arch is on the east side of the canyon (and the only one of the eight arches on the east side); the other two, though large, are easy to miss if you are the driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \u00a0Peek-a-Boo Arch\r\n\u00a0Double Arch \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Trailhead to narrows-- Enjoy the pinnacles, walls, and arches (five of them).  Only one arch, the second one, has a name (Saddle Arch).  It is massive and pink and is just before the junction with the Rim Trail; it can be approached with a little clambering, and intrepid scramblers might make it up the steepening sandstone to stand directly beneath it.  The first arch is also very large.  The third and fourth are higher up on the canyon walls and would be difficult to reach, but the fifth, just yards away from the start of the narrows, is close to the ground and the easiest of all five to access.  It is at the mouth of a short slot canyon joining the main one, and although it can be easy to miss, it is also easy to see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \u00a0First arch\r\n\u00a0Saddle Arch (second arch)\r\n\u00a0Third arch\r\n\u00a0Fifth arch \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs noted, the narrows begin shortly after the fifth arch.  If you reach the narrows, backtrack a little and look for cairns on the east (right) side marking a way to climb up and around the narrows.  The route does not yet make its ascent for the rim above; that comes after some climbing and skirting to the head of the canyon.\r\nEntrance to narrows\r\nOnce the trail reaches the crest of the rim, also the crest of the Waterpocket Fold, enjoy the gentle journey and the sweeping 360-degree views.  If you seem to lose the exact way, look around for cairns.

One explanation holds that in ancient times, the Dolores River flowed through Unaweep and into the Gunnison River south Grand Junction. A second explanation is that the Gunnison River itself once flowed through the canyon.

This is especially evident at Juniper, Quarry, and Divide Walls, where the rock is of exceptionally high quality and would be generally classified as a quartz monzonite. \nThe canyon began forming some 300 million years ago during the Uncompahgre Uplift and now displays a great unconformity, with Triasic red rocks lying directly on top of the Precambrian granite and metamorphic rocks.

At the east side of the pullout is a dirt road which angles off to the east at 45 degrees. Take this road and drive a short distance along the fence to a gate and park, then make a direct 10 to 15 minute approach to the base by foot. The book describes 2 routes: Trail of the Serpent 5.10+, 7 pitches, and Tail of the Serpent 5.10-, variation of the previous one. Castle RockPrivate property 13.3 miles west of Divide Road on the north side of Highway 141. Basically, across from Thimble Rock. Park at the Driggs Mansion pullout on Highway 141, carefully cross the barb wire fence and make a 30 minute direct line-of-sight approach. This 215 feet pinnacle offers only two routes, but \"Crown Jewel 5.10-\" is worth the walk. Adventure WallBLM land, 13.5 miles west of Divide Road on the north side of Highway 141, with a private property approach. Park again at Driggs Mansion pullout, cross the barb wire fence and make a 50 minute direct line-of-sight approach. At 500 feet in height, the main wall offers some exciting climbing and a significant amount of unexplored rock. The book describes only 3 multi-pitch 5.10s routes. Unaweep WallSituated near the wester extent of Unaweep Canyon, this beautiful wall is located approximately 23.5 miles west of Divide Road on the north side of Highway 141. It is also located about 9.0 miles east of Gateway, and 10.5 miles west of Thimble Rock. It lies within BLM  boundaries.

It is located just about 5-6 meters left of the point where the Access Fund trail meets the wall. Look for a vertical hand crack leading to a small ledge. The photo shows the ledge, and only the lower portion of the hand crack. I enjoyed practicing on this little section of the crack. Once on the first smaller ledge, just follow the crack to a bigger ledge, and the anchors will be very obvious. I thought that the climb got much easier higher up. Did place one medium size nut, and one medium size camalot. Descent: rappel with a single rope from the anchors. 1 pitch, 55-60 feet long. The guide book writes about a walk off, which I did not see, but rappel works great. Mountain Project DescriptionCrack of Don 5.6\u00a0\u00a0Location:Lower Sun TowerCrack of Don is located 25 feet uphill from \"Sunup\", obviously bolted route. Climb a broken hand crack up and slightly left for 80 feet to the same 2 bolt rappel anchor as for \"Sunup\". Descent: Rappel the route, there is also a walk off, which I did not try.

The photos show the route well. The climb follows the thin cracks. It looks pretty hard, but the small holds really hold. There is one bolt, otherwise many options for small to medium size gear placement. There are fixed anchors at the top. The descent is to rappel down. This is one of my favorite climbs. I did once 5 laps back to back on Dovencourt! Length: 70 feet, 1 pitch\u00a0Mountain Project DescriptionIt is a popular route. Beginner's Luck 5.7\u00a0\u00a0Location: Sunday Wall\u00a0Beginner's Luck is numbered 1 on Sunday Wall in Baum's rock climbing guide. It is located on the left side from the Access Trail. You follow a small climber's path uphill. Baum's is writing about climbing an obvious right leaning hand crack, which is actually hard to spot. So we headed straight up on the smooth face towards the 1st bolt and anchors high above that. The climb was located behind a tree. There were 2 bolts on this route, and it was definitively harder than 5.7, especially the climb to the first bolt, which was about 6-7 meters high. I realized later that I climbed a more difficult routes, and \"Beginner's Luck\" was just a few meters to the west. The bolts were confusing on this climb. Descent: rappel Mountain Project Description and hopefully more helpful information. Welcoming Party 5.7+\u00a0\u00a0Location: Lower Mother Buttress Starts as below mentioned No Name Route. Climb fingers into good hands up to a good ledge below a small alcove with offwidth above. Use sideways body stem to pass the offwidth (crux!) and gain a big sloping ledge. Finish straight up an open book corner with big chockstones and climb into big alcove and belay (85 feet). Descent: Walk to east end of ledge and downclimb class 3 and class 4 to the ground. Or you can rappel the route. Pro: small to large nuts, stoppers and cams, #4 camalot for the crux. Fixed anchors at the top. Mountain Project Description I loved the comment \"It would probably be called 5.10 in Boulder Canyon and have a few bolts on it\".Fearless First 5.8\u00a0\u00a0Location: Sunday Wall\u00a0Baum's guide describes the same start as Beginner's Luck, so that is what we did. We followed the bolted route up to the anchors, 4 bolts, 70 feet route. I thought that this route was more difficult than 5.8, but again not sure if we were on the right route. Baum's guide is also describing 2 pitons, which we did not encounter. The first section was exactly same as Beginner's right, and then we moved to the right. We ended up at the same anchors. Descent: rappel. I realized later that we climbed some unknown bolted route, and Fearless First was what I was thinking is Beginner's Luck. So, please don't pay too much attention to too many bolts on this wall. Mountain Project DescriptionCow-a-Bunga 5.8\u00a0\u00a0Location: Lower Mother ButtressStarts in a vertical hand crack next to a pine tree. Climb crack and chimney straight up for 120 feet to a big open corner with off width crack. Move right onto face and climb finger crack up through hands and fists to a big ledge. There are anchors at the top, or you can walk off to the east. (we got above the anchors and down climb to some other climbers on 4th class terrain). We also did the 5.9 variation to the left that follows a finger crack. Mountain Project DescriptionSunup 5.8\u00a0\u00a0Location: Lower Sun TowerThis climb is easy to find if you follow the access trail towards Lower Sun Tower. The path is well marked, and brings you to the bottom of Lower Sun Tower Cliff, bolts are easy to spot. The climb is located on the lower east face of the tower, just a little uphill. Climb the face past 7 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor (sharing anchors with Crack of Don). I though that one move close to the bolt #4 required a 5.9 move. Length: 80 feet. Descent: Rappel the route. Mountain Project DescriptionNo Name Route 5.9\u00a0\u00a0Location: Lower Mothers Buttress Start in vertical crack (just west of Welcoming Party). Climb fingers and hands for 10 feet, then move left into off width section. Climb trough the offwidth onto a sloping ledge at the base of a beautiful hand crack. Climb slightly overhanging hands into loose fingers (crux) up to a sloping ledge, then finish straight up a 5.7 open book corner with big hands (I thought very large hands - it was OW for me) to a large ledge and belay (90 feet). Descent: Walk to east end of a ledge and down climb class 3 and class 4 to the ground. Or you can rap from fixed anchors.  Pro: small to large cams recommended up 3.0. Mountain Project DescriptionSweet Sunday Serenade 5.9\u00a0\u00a0Location:Sunday Wall Likely most the most popular 3 pitch route in Unaweep Canyon. Begin at a left facing dihedral with a right leaning hand crack. Pitch 1: The crux comes right off the ground with a wide stem and long reach for a hand crack (5.8). Climb fingers, hands and short off width up to a big sloping ledge with a 2 bolt rappel anchor at the east end (135 feet). Pitch 2: Climb 5.9 fingers/face in the corner for 20 feet. At this point the route leaves the main crack and angles left into a thin crack, then continues straight up to a good ledge in dike rock (75 feet). Pitch 3: Scramble 10 feet up to Sun Deck Ledge. Walk toward the west end of the ledge and climb the crack that splits  the face and leans right. Climb the right angling crack up to a ledge at the base of a detached flake. Climb the flake and gain a nice finger crack and climb straight up through 5.9 fingers/hands. Near the top of cliff, a face traverse right will lead directly to the rappel station at the top of \"Sun Dancer\". (155 feet).

I wouldn\u2019t want to navigate this short section in wet conditions or in bad weather. The road, although graded is loose and steep. There isn\u2019t room for vehicles to pass along this section. \r\nOnce in the canyon, the road becomes tighter with a few 75\u00b0-90\u00b0 turns. As stated above, don\u2019t take a full-size truck. A small size truck (Tacoma) or Jeep would be at home here. Sagers Canyon isn\u2019t marked. The \u2018main\u2019 jeep road will be dissected by a small canyon. This canyon is Sagers. \r\nYou can keep to the right and eventually take another side road which will lead you out and down onto Sagers Flats and ultimately back to I-70. Staying straight will dead-end. If you stop and take the canyon to the left, this tight and constrictive wash will climb steeply on a rotten, loose and spun-out road till it reaches a plateau where it once again becomes gentler. This road will continue for quite a ways and eventually dead-end.\r\n \r\nMy odometer came out to 14.9 miles. There is a wash down below of the road that is easily navigateable by foot.

Crescent Canyon can be reached from the west (Floy Canyon Wash), east (Thompson Springs) and directly from the south (Brendel). \r\nDetailing the eastern approach, exit I-70 at Thompson Springs at exit #187. \r\nTravel north up towards the cliffs driving through the \u2018fingernail\u2019 town of Thompson Springs on Main Street. This will switch into Sego Canyon Road (or Cty. #159) about a half mile outside of town. Follow this north for 3.6 miles. Pass the two right hand Jeep roads on the right side (at mile 3.5) and take the next left onto the Jeep Road at 3.6 miles. This is also known as #331. Follow this excellent and well-maintained dirt & hardscrabble road for approximately 11.8 miles. \r\nThe scenery along this stretch is amazing and incredible. There are a few 4x4 spur roads along this segment but ignore them. After taking two of them, they all cliff out to the south. Stay on #331. The road at mile 11.8 will delve down sharply into a wash and cross over to the other side. There is a brown wilderness study marker in the bottom of this wash. Either park here at coordinates: 39\u00b0 01\u2019 93\u201dN// 109\u00b0 47\u2019 94\u201dW or continue up into the wash following the tire tracks of which there are usually a few sets. \r\nCrescent Butte (6,872ft) dominates the skyline directly to the northwest. The altitude here is 5,428ft. \r\n\r\nOn a side note, as previously mentioned, it is possible to reach Crescent Canyon from the south and this is actually more direct. Leave the ghost town of Crescent Junction-Brendel, which is exit #182 off I-70. Follow Railroad road to the northwest across open pasture and at a fork in the road, take the right-hand fork (#224) and this will climb up into the lower recesses of Crescent Canyon and join up with #331. \r\nFrom this T-intersection, it is only .3-.4 mile (towards the right) to the proper wash. I\u2019m not sure if this open pasture is private or not. There is some DOE land/buildings very close nearby so I don\u2019t recommend this route in.\r\n", "Camping": "Pretty much all of Crescent Canyon is BLM land. \r\nso as far as camping is concerned, throw your stakes anywhere that looks good.\r\nHowever, you might want to consider a few things first: wash's, cacti, cryptobiotic soil, ant mounds, sunhit, etc...\r\nAnd remember, leave no trace. ", "The Canyon": "\u00a0Crescent Flats The entrance to this canyon starts out in a wash (as most canyons in the desert southwest do). If you\u2019re uncomfortable with leaving a vehicle parked in a riverbed, albeit a dry one, simply drive on up a short ways and park. Leave the road (39\u00b0 01\u2019 93\u201dN// 109\u00b0 47\u2019 94\u201dW) and proceed 350\u00b0m, basically almost due north. The elevation here is 5,428ft. The first mile is fairly open, wide and to be honest, lackluster in scenery. At .5 mile, another wash will present itself on the right at almost 90\u00b0m. This is the start of the Right-Hand branch. Shortly afterwards, the Middle branch will come up, also on the right.\r\n \r\nAfter the first 1.1mile, things will start to get interesting. The canyon never really truly constricts but it does narrow significantly enough to attract ones attention. The next 1.2 miles is scenic as the stratum from the walls is quite obvious. You\u2019d almost expect to see bones or fossils buried and sticking out. \r\nAn odd thing is that there are occasional pieces of mining equipment strewn in the wash from the first split into the upper recesses. Using a USGS Floy Canyon South 7.5\u2019 quad map, I cannot locate any mines anywhere except for the Crescent Mine, which is located 1.5 miles southwest. Weird.\r\nThere are some side washes on the left (meaningless) and the canyon will eventually split. This split occurs at 5,636ft. and at coordinates 39\u00b0 1\u2019 90\u201dN//-109\u00b0 47\u2019 92\u201dW.\r\n \r\nThe left canyon quickly peters out after .75 mile. Proceed 26\u00b0m into the right canyon and follow for either the whole ~3.3 miles or at leisure. The canyon in this upper portion takes on a different face as it becomes entrenched and deeper because of the increasing ridgelines and more scenic. \r\nFollow your course in as your exit.\r\n\r\nAs another option, the Crescent Mine is worth a side trip to visit. This mine used to produce coal in the early part of the 20th century and was shut down due to a run on the vein. It is a quiet and lonely place with nothing left of the buildings or mine save for debris, splinters and jetsam. \r\nIt's mind-boggeling walking around among the ruins to know this area actually supported a small human population. Makes you wonder if life was all about work & money. In the summer, it would be hot as hell.           \r\n", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0The Narrows Crescent Canyon is a bit of a surprise. Upon viewing the higher portions of the Bookcliffs, the terrain is forbiddingly similar and lacking stark differences or notable features. It\u2019s only when time and effort are invested does one discover the small intricacies and exceptions of these individual canyons. \r\nCrescent Canyon is one of my more favourite places in the Bookcliffs because of the ease of navigation, the astounding solitude, the mining history involved with this place and that there are three canyons that make up this entrenched massif.\r\n \r\nCrescent Canyon starts out as an unassuming wash in what is essentially a scared and open basin located west of Blaze Canyon. The central portions narrow down to a moderately cut but still open passage that gives easy access to the higher reaches. The sedimentary strata and layers through this section are amazing as they show the layering quite well. The higher reaches of Crescent Canyon open back up briefly and then narrow down again into some spectacular scenery. \r\nThere is also a Right-Hand and a Middle branch that is accessed from below in the basin.\r\n \r\nLocated even further west and more conveniently accessed via a Wilderness Study Road, is the Crescent Mine (5,715ft). There is a standard brown fiberglass marker located at the beginning of this short road where one can choose to park at or continue on down the rough 4x4 road for an additional .4-.5 mile to an obvious cut created by storm runoff/erosion that runs directly through the road. There are some old timbers buried here from a long ago bridge. \r\nThere isn\u2019t much left at the mine but scattered debris, a fair amount of timber/wood from what I\u2019m assuming to be a central bunkhouse of some kind, scattered mining equipment and two shafts, one vertical and one horizontal. The mine operated from 1920-1948 and was primarily used for coal.\u00a0\u00a0 \r\nCrescent Canyon is not difficult to reach but it might take one some navigation to find. It is a pleasant and very easy hike and solitude is 100% guaranteed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrescent Canyon is located as one of many ranked quad points within the quadrangle of Floy Canyon South.\r\n\r\nView Larger Map\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Feb21,2009/Feb22,2009", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=38.98553&amp;distance_lon_9=-109.81707&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.98553\u00b0N/109.81707\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

Passage of the canyon can be completed without any serious climbing that exceeds the level of 2+.  But despite relatively easy passage, most visitors of the canyon choose to explore the eastern half usually turning back after reaching the first or second waterfall.  Consequently, the remaining six miles of the canyon are left virtually untouched making for an almost primeval experience.", "Route": "There are two routes one can take to experience No Thoroughfare Canyon. \r\n\r\nThe most popular route starts from the lower trailhead and winds its way up the canyon until reaching either the first or second prominent waterfall.  The trip can take anywhere from four to six miles round trip.  For instance, a round trip to the first waterfall is approximately four miles and a trip to the second waterfall is approximately five to six miles round trip.  When attempting this route be sure not to be fooled by the succession of waterfalls.  There is a small waterfall that holds a considerable amount of water approximately a mile into the hike.  This smaller waterfall fooled me several times into believing I had been reaching the second waterfall when in fact I had only reached the first.\r\n\r\nBegin your escapade by heading south from the lower trailhead shared with serpents trail.  A well maintained trail will guide you nearby devils kitchen in a westerly direction.  Continue to follow the canyon bed which may or may not have water in it.  Avoid the temptation to follow one of the canyon\u2019s branches to the left.  Soon after you\u2019ll come to a small waterfall and pool that is circumvented to its right.  The trail continues from there into the canyon\u2019s Precambrian zone that is interspersed with cottonwood and willow trees.  Approximately two miles from the trailhead you\u2019ll reach the first of two prominent waterfalls.  Overcoming the waterfall requires ascending the steep trail that winds up and to the right of the main fall.  Once past the first waterfall, continue up the canyon through the increasingly denser thickets and primitive trail until you reach the second major waterfall approximately a mile after the first.  This waterfall makes for a good turnaround point as the trail from here becomes more difficult and less apparent.\r\n\r\nAn enjoyable through hike of the canyon can be completed by a car shuttle.   Start from the small pullout atop the canyon by following a small path and a few signs that indicate your direction.  The trail starts by switch backing down the canyon side into an area thick with pinon pine and juniper trees.  If possible, follow a primitive trail passing through the upper canyon\u2019s confluence\u2014the upper canyon consists of three small branches, the trail drops down in the middle branch and shortly meets up with the other pair.  This may require a serious bushwhack as the brush here is painstakingly thick.  Once you pass the confluence try to gain the west side of the arroyo, the vegetation present in this section will make your course fairly obvious.  Follow the meandering trail through sagebrush that gives way to the Precambrian rock zone.  At this point drop down into the arroyo and follow it until you reach a large drop of several hundred feet.  This point marks the spot of the canyon\u2019s prominent waterfall.  From here head northwest up a rocky outcrop, cairns will guide you atop the rocky outcrop until you reach a draw that will take you down to the waterfalls base.  Continue down the canyon and rejoin with your car parked at the lower trailhead--the remainder of the canyon\u2019s route can be made by referring to the alternate route description.  The length of this route is approximately eight and half miles and experiences an elevation change of approximately 1900 feet.    \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jan4,2010/Jul9,2012", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=39.02292&amp;distance_lon_9=-108.64380&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">39.02292\u00b0N/108.6438\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Backcountry camping requires a free permit that is administered at the visitor center.

There is a very large campground to accommodate numerous RV\u2019s near the park entrance and a campground for people with horses nearby.  There are also two tent campgrounds.  One is functional, but not situated near the entrances to the canyons and inconvenient.  The other seems to be the most popular, which is justifiable since it is at the mouth of the South Prong Canyon.  Of course, out here, popular is sort of relative, since few people come out this way.  \r\n\r\nThere are also two primitive \u201cbackpacker\u201d campgrounds located inside the canyons.  The north prong primitive campground is located 1 mile north of the South Prong trailhead.  The South Prong primitive campground is 1.25 miles west of the trailhead.  Neither of these looks particularly attractive, since they are too close to the trailhead.  \r\n \r\n\u00a0Looking west into South Prong Canyon\r\nFor those intent on a wilderness trip it is possible to load up your backpack and set up camp at the Fern Cave in North Prong Canyon.  This is the best location for camping in the park.  Another option is to set up camp on Haynes Ridge, however, if you do not want an extremely windy night, stay clear of this option and head down to the Fern Cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Formation in South Prong Canyon.\r\n\r\nNorth and South Prong Canyons, located in Caprock Canyons State Park, may be the best slice of Texas\u2019 Caprock Canyonlands.  When approaching from either the east or the west, one is unlikely to suspect the rugged, twisted landscape lying amidst the Caprock escarpment that separates the southern portion of the Great Plains in western Texas from the High Plains atop the Llano Estacado.  Once entered, one is struck by the similarity between the canyons and regions found on the Colorado Plateau.  Twisting slot canyons, balanced rocks and monoliths are the order of the day in these red wonderlands. \r\n\r\nWhile not nearly as well known or as large as the Palo Duro Canyon to the north, the North and South Prong Canyons offer equally fantastic vistas as their bigger brother to the north.  They also offer greater solitude and less development than the touristy Palo Duro.  Where the Palo Duro is wide and long, the Prong Canyons are significantly narrower and much more intimate.  Consequently one does not have to travel as far to climb the cliffs and explore the slots and drainages. \r\n\r\nNorth and South Prong Canyons run parallel to each other with an east \u2013 west orientation.  They are separated by Haynes Ridge.  The cliffs average between 600 and 700 feet high.  A 7.5 mile trail loops through both canyons and climbs Haynes ridge.  At the ridge summit a spur trail leads 2 miles to the east to the Haynes Ridge Overlook, with impressive vistas of both canyon mouths and the plains stretching out to the east.  \r\n\u00a0The Caprock Escarpment at the mouths of North and South Prong Canyons\r\nThere are numerous points of interest in the canyons.  At the extreme western end of the North Prong Canyon is the Fern Cave, a lush grotto with a small seeping spring and numerous ferns.  The north canyon also has numerous stone spires.  The South Prong Canyon has some small balanced rocks more reminiscent of southern Utah than west Texas.  In the South Prong also stands the very cool Mitten.  Although smaller than the tremendous Lighthouse in the Palo Duro, the South Prong Mitten is nonetheless an incredible and interesting formation.  \r\n  \r\n ", "Created/Edited": "Mar9,2007/Dec2,2010", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=34.44769&amp;distance_lon_9=-101.09070&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">34.44769\u00b0N/101.0907\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "An entrance fee is required to enter the park.

One of the most relevant magazines on Spain, Desnivel, has dedicated several articles to describe some ascension on the Hoces de Vegacervera walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe human component of the canyon it\u00b4s a road going on its right and left and some bridges. The reason of this road along this canyon was an old idea: it was planned for this road to be the main way between Asturias in the North and Le\u00f3n and the rest lands on the South of Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica massif, So the road crossing the canyon was constructed. The rest of the plan was a road from the village of Piedrafita on Le\u00f3n province and Casomera in Asturias, crossing the mountains through Puerto de Piedrafita mountain pass (1683 m). Finally the road from the village of Piedrafita to the col was constructed but the road wasn\u00b4t covered by asphalt, and the road from Asturias to the col was never stated, and today theres only a mountain trail along dark and wet asturian forests. The reason why was the election of Puerto de Pajares (N-630) to play this role of communicating Asturias with the rest of Spain. Nowadays Hoces de Vegacervera let comunications with villages along Tor\u00edo valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canyon it\u00b4s close related with the famous cave, the Cueva de Valporquero. The subterrain river that formed the main galleries of the cave (first level) and now goes over, on the second level (know as Curso de Aguas de Valporquero) finishes on the Tor\u00edo river along the canyon. It\u00b4s possible to access the low part of Curso de Aguas through the cave some meters over the canyon, situated on the West (not far from Felm\u00edn), place what is considered the end of Curso de Aguas (accessing without permision it\u00b4s not allowed, and accessing without equipment could be a suicide).\r\n\u00a0Curso de Aguas entry\r\n\r\n\r\nNot far from there, there is a construction, in other times very important for the economy of the people of the villages around: El Calero de Felm\u00edn, \r\na big furnace where limestone where transform into lime, used for building.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Calero del Felm\u00edn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main peak around, it\u00b4s the famous Correcillas peak, situated on the East of the canyon and visible from Vegacervera. The typical access to the peak it\u00b4s from Rodillazo, a village 2-3 km from Felm\u00edn, but it\u00b4s possible to access the plateau of Valle del Marques, where the North face of Correcillas peak stands, throug a hard and long pass that starts on Hoces de Vegacervera, some meters on the North of El Calero, that has the name of Paso del Lobo (Wolf  Pass).\r\n\r\n", "Red Tape": "As in other mountains in Le\u00f3n province there\u00b4s nothing special to say about.

They provide a pleasant excursion from Columbus, Ohio being about 50 miles to the southeast.  The area consists of small hollows and box canyons and I have the recollection that there is at least one point from which no houses can be seen-a rather unusual condition in Ohio.  The attractions include Old Mans cave, Cedar Falls, Conkles Hollow  and other areas of interest.  The Hocking Hills region is located in southeast Ohio. Rivers and streams snake through the little canyons flanked by soaring  sandstone cliffs. Thick forests are the habitat to a diverse number of animal species and plants. Tens of thousands of acres of state parks and state and national forest offer fun hiking and interesting topography, as well as quiet places for relaxation.  Conkles hollow was named for W.J. Conkle who left his name and the date 1797 carved into the sandstone on the west wall of the gorge. Conkles Hollow is a state nature preserve operated by the state of Ohio.  The park was started by 1924 with the purchase of 146 acres centered at Old Mans Cave by the state of Ohio.

Similiar to its neighboring canyons\u2019 trails, the Romaero Canyon trail climbs gently along a year-round stream, and eventually terminates on East Camino Cielo Road.

The Zugspitze with it's height of 2964 m, the Waxenstein with 2267 m, the H\u00f6llentalspitzen with 2720 m and the Osterfelder with a height of 2050 m are forming the deep valley. The elevation of the river in the  bottom of the Canyon is about 1100 m above sea level in average.\r\n\r\nThe H\u00f6llentalklamm is a 150 m deep and in average 15 m wide canyon. The river Hammersbach roars through it's entire length. The river is fed by the melting waters of the H\u00f6llental Glacier just below the Zugspitze, Germany's highest peak. The trail was constructed in the early 1900's and is maintained by the German Alpine Club. At the entrance hut the hiker will pay a toll which contributes to the high maintaining costs. Every fall and spring the boardwalks and bridges are getting removed and re-installed to prevent damage by massive avalanches busting into the canyon during the winter month.\r\n\r\nThe trail though the H\u00f6llentalklamm is a wet and cold adventure. Water is dripping from above, water is running in little streams along and across the trail. Drizzle will blow right into your face and I bet your socks don't stay dry for long. It's noisy too, the river roars through it's narrow bed and cascades down over tall steps, boulders and logs. The water is ice-cold because it's melting water from a glacier further above the valley. In the spring time the maintenance crew is digging holes and tunnels into the avalanche debris from the past winter to get going.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "Lower AccessThere are two main access points for Hog Canyon. The lower one is located at the Hog Springs Recreation area on Utah Highway 95\u00a0on the west side of the road at mile marker 33.5. Here there is a vault toilet restroom, a large parking area and a wooden suspension bridge over the stream leading to some sheltered picnic tables. A trail leads up the canyon for 1 mile through the lush area all the way to the spring at 4,250 feet in elevation. This is 150 feet above the trailhead on the highway so it's a pretty flat trail. At times the trail can be difficult to follow but it's not bad. Continuing further upcanyon will lead you to a few more smaller springs, and eventually to the mouth of the upper Hog Canyon Slots up at 4,460 feet. There may be some short scrambling sections to climb up but nothing hard. Typically people looking to do the upper slots start at the upper access point described below.\u00a0\nA view of Hog Springs and the cliff jump\nThe springs when the water is muddy - By AmericanSouthwest.netUpper AccessTo access Hog Canyon from above, turn right onto Utah Highway 276 towards Bullfrog and continue southwest on this road for\u00a03.6 miles to a small dirt road on the left, across from a yellow warning sign. The road is not at all obvious and it's almost guaranteed you will miss it the first time and have to turn around. Follow this rough high clearance 4WD road (known as the Trachyte Point Road) 2.1 miles to a wide spot at the top of a hill just before the roads turns right and heads down the steep hill. There is a small high point here and parking for three or four vehicles. This place would be a great place to camp. If you have a passenger car with 2WD you can get about a mile up this road until some really deep sand will force you to park along side the road. Walk the last mile to the trailhead.From the trailhead, locate a new boot path that heads to the northeast towards the west rim of Hog 4 and Hog 1 slots. Once you reach the rim follow it north to the head of the upper slots. This approach hike is about 1.5 miles and will take a little less than an hour. The first major drainage is Hog 1 (Boss Hog) with an ACA rating of 3A II. If you continue around to the east and over a small bench you will reach Hog 2 with a rating of 3A II and even further east will get you to Hog 3 (Razorback) with a 3A II R rating. Hog 3 is slightly tougher as some of the descents are more challenging without the opportunity to set up a rappel anchor. Whichever fork you choose, you will end up in Hog Canyon near the upper springs and you have a few exit options which are described below.

From the mouth of Hog 1 and Hog 2, hike down the main drainage a short ways and locate a prominent side canyon heading northwest (not to be confused with the one heading southwest from the same spot). Hike up this side canyon which is very easy at first with a few scramble sections. At first the upper part looks very intimidating but rest assured it goes. Scramble up loose rocky terrain which never exceeds class 3 and when you get to a steep chimney that appears 4th class, locate a nice ledge to the left and scramble up a short slab with nice holds (moderate exposure) and up the final sandy slope to the rim.

Most people will do Hog 1 and Hog 2 using this exit hike out which heads up the ridge between the two slots.\u00a0Start where Hog 2 drains out into Hog 1 and look for a low angle slab, then a steeper slab just above. Carefully climb up both slabs following the easiest way up using holds when you see them.

There are places on the Balkans and on other islands (like Sardinia) which might compete for second place but there is no question about the number one. Europe's longest gorges, the Samaria and Aradena can be found here but the karst-like structure of the mountain ranges ensure that almost all valleys are profound with near vertical walls. While most of the gorges are rather wide and can easily be hiked - often mule trails connect mountain villages through the gorges - there are some wild canyons which are filled with huge boulders over which more or less difficult paths lead.\r\n\r\nThe Diktanos Gorge (\u0394\u03c8\u03ba\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf \u03a6\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03b7 in Greek) is one of these more difficult gorges. It runs from east to west, which in itself already is an exception of the rule. It lies between the villages of Kathori (west) and Stilos (east) and is some 6km long. If you stretch the boundaries a bit you can say that it belongs to the northern outskirts of the Levka Ori Range, Crete's White Mountains. The gorge - apart from being filled with boulders - is also fille which ancient (and giant) maple and sycamore trees, which makes it a perfect place in Crete's summer heat. \r\n\r\nStill the gorge is very dry. Like many of the Cretan canyons, the Diktanos Gorge carries water only in its upper part. A little creek, which comes down from the Levka Ori enters the gorge but after several hundred metres it vanishes beneath the ground. The old trees with their deep roots are able to get at this water which ensures a dense canopy above the canyon floor. However, taking pictures of the canyon thus is made very difficult.\r\n\r\nUnlike other canyons the boulders in the Diktanos Gorge are not polished so that - while still pretty strenuous - scrambling through the gorge dosn't pose any major difficulties. Orientation can be tricky though in some places there are marks for the path. Especially among the shady trees the marks are missing and you can be sure to not find any in the climbing sections. The Diktanos Gorge is a short scramble of about 2-3h one way. \r\n  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      ", "Created/Edited": "Jul11,2007/Aug31,2007", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=35.44060&amp;distance_lon_9=24.10409&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">35.44060\u00b0N/24.10409\u00b0E</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Diktanos Kid\r\nI'm not aware of any red tape here.

The access road for the campground is at MP 79.5.

It is the park\u2019s largest campground, but it will usually fill on holiday and October weekends.  The fee for a campsite is $15 per night (as of 2007, higher if you reserve).\r\n\r\nBackcountry camping is free (no fires allowed), but a permit is required.  Permits are available at entrance stations and ranger stations and can often be done in self-serve style.\r\n\r\nThe Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC) operates and maintains several cabins in and near the park, and the Doyles River Cabin, one of the nicest, is a short walk from the trailhead.  The cabins are rustic and have no electricity or running water but do have fireplaces, wood-burning stoves, bunks (with mattresses and blankets, if you want them), and they are the best places to stay in the park.

Waterfalls are the scenic highlights of the canyons, but the canyons are also excellent places to see immense trees, abundant wildflowers (March through November), dozens of small cataracts and crystal-clear pools, and the colorful foliage that draws thousands of visitors to the Blue Ridge on October weekends (hint\u2014to avoid the crowds but still enjoy the colors, visit in early November, when there is usually still plenty of nice color but the crowds are gone).  There are also numerous rock outcrops that can provide much scrambling and bouldering fun for children and adults alike.\r\n\r\nDoyles is the steeper of the two gorges and probably the more dramatic.  It narrows considerably at times, revealing sheer cliffs and giving the feel of a wild mountain canyon.  There are two main waterfalls along the trail, the lower one being the higher at 63\u2019 and falling in two steps between high cliffs (the upper is 28\u2019 and falls in three steps in a more-open setting).  Standing at the base of the upper falls during a period of high runoff, though, you will think that for the force and the roar of the water, the falls are much higher.  In such conditions, it is one of the park\u2019s most impressive waterfalls.\r\n\r\nAnother nice thing about Doyles River and Jones Run is that although neither is a secret and both are quite popular, being in the South District (which sees less visitation and trail use than the park\u2019s other two districts do), their trails are not nearly as busy as those in other well-known waterfall areas such as Dark Hollow Falls and Whiteoak Canyon.\r\n\r\nA good trail runs through the canyon and connects with the Jones Run Trail, the Appalachian Trail (AT) and the Browns Gap Fire Road to form loops that many, if not most, visitors to these streams follow.  The trail is pretty steep, though, dropping about 1400\u2019 in 2.2 miles to its junction with the Jones Run Trail, where the streams merge.  The longer loop is nearly twice as long as just hiking down and back out, but the shorter loop really is not that much longer and harder than the down-and-back option.  It\u2019s almost foolish not to hike the loop; the extra scenery is more than worth the extra effort.  Note: if one is hiking the shorter loop, he or she should begin from the Jones Run Trailhead, not the one for Doyles River.\r\n\r\nLoop Details (from Doyles River Parking Area at 2870\u2019)\u2014\r\n\u2022\t0.3 miles: Spur trail goes 0.1 mi uphill to Doyles River Cabin.\r\n\u2022\t0.9: Browns Gap Fire Road (keep going straight).\r\n\u2022\t1.2: Upper falls.

The plane took off at 7 am from Albuquerque airport for a 29 minute hop to Santa Fe. Three minutes later pilot radioed that the plane was off the ground and on its way. Then there was silence. The search was difficult due to violent snowstorms. The rugged west face of the Sandia Mountains yielded the scattered and burned wreckage of a Trans World Airlines plane. Bits of the plane were spotted from the air early Sunday morning (the accident happened on Saturday). Ground crews reached the desolate site of the crash near sundown. They reported no signs of life.

This is a really nice surprise. Pull open any guidebook to Colorado and Utah with the hikes and climbs marked, and notice the big blank spot in Northwestern Colorado and Northeast Utah.  The peaks in this area are incredibly spectacular and almost completely ignored, despite the fact that it offers some of the best scenery in the lower 48 states. There is enough exploring here to keep one busy for years.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of spectacular canyons here as well. From big and scenic to tight slot canyons, this area has enough exploring left for years. There are literally dozens of seemingly completely unexplored slot canyons in the area. \r\n\r\nHog Canyon is one of those canyons.  It wasn't descended in its entirety until June 2016. \r\n\r\nThe canyon is an impressively rugged gorge cutting through thick sandstone layers in Dinosaur National Monument. It also guards its secrets well and most of the canyon is seemingly inaccessible. The lower end of the canyon is a gentle and friendly place with a crystal clear stream gurgling through ambient grassy meadows. A century ago, Josie Morris homesteaded the area and kept the lower part of the canyon as a corral since animals couldn\u2019t go very far up the canyon.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had been hiking in Dinosaur National Monument since at least the early 1980\u2019s, Hog Canyon was the earliest of the technical canyons that I attempted in the Monument. This was in April 2003. It took four tries over a 13 year period to finally descend the canyon.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the very bottom of Hog Canyon is warm and inviting, but with big scenic walls, but the upper end of the canyon has a huge headwall. What lay between these two locations was a big question mark until 2016. I knew that it wasn't a tight and classic slot canyon, but I still wanted to descend the canyon and its impressively deep gorge. \r\n\r\nWe discovered that the canyon was both a beauty and a beast. If you want to descend it, here is the information.\r\n\r\nMe on the last stage of a 400+ foot drop in Hog Canyon (Dinosaur National Monument) yesterday. We made the first descent of the canyon, but didn't get too many photos. It was beautiful, but difficult; 11 hours to go two miles. \r\n\r\nThe pleasant and easy section of lower Hog Canyon.

There are at least six rappels and several 5th class downclimbs.

The narrows can be seen far below.\r\n\r\nTop Down\r\n\r\nFrom the trailhead, follow the old road down into Docs Valley and then north and west around Point 7613 and to the head of the drainage draining into Hog Canyon.   Follow this drainage downstream, while negotiating several obstacles such as brush, boulders, and minor drop offs.  You will eventually reach the headwall of the canyon, a huge pourover and drop of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nA zoom shot of lower Hog Canyon as taken from high on the bench near the headwall.\r\n\r\nFrom the big drop, retreat back up canyon until you can climb west up to the first bench above the big drop (there is a bench at the same level as the big drop, but I don't know if it goes).  Follow this bench west to it's end.\r\n\r\nThere is a secure tree that makes an anchor for stage one of the 400 foot drop.   All anchors are done with trees or bushes. (I stuck my rope on the 2nd stage and it is still there.  If you find it, I'd appreciate it being returned!).  \r\n\r\nScramble down canyon, staying in the drainage.  There are several downclimbs and rappels, but none are as high as the initial drops.\r\n\r\nRappel #5.\r\n\r\nLast Rappel.\r\n\r\nOnce you are at the bottom of the last rappel, there is still lots of scrambling and boulder-hopping, but the major difficulties are over.

Stone walls consisting of conglomerate sandstone now line the canyon, while dense ponderosa pine and douglas fur slope towards the canyon's drainage. Though the area looks arid, Castlewood collects an average of 19 inches of precipitation every year. The winters are cold allowing ice to form on the surrounding walls and in some cases on the creek itself. At times ice is thick and plentiful enough to allow climbers a quick escape on the Front Range. During the warmer months, hiking is very popular. All of the trails in the park are less than two miles in length but can be combined to make for a very long day. In fact, up to 13 miles can be traveled within the canyon. Expect to see a variety of wildlife. Snakes are very common and one should be cautious of this as there are rattlesnakes in the area. In addition, a hiker can see bobcats, bats, lizards, deer, many species of birds, butterflies, flowers and much more. Beware of poison ivy, as it can be found along all trails in the park. Another popular aspect of the area is the rock climbing potential. Castlewood Canyon's walls are typically around 40-50 feet tall. Some of the routes can be lead with natural protection, others have been bolted, while many, many more can be climbed with a toprope setup.\r\n\r\nIn addition to directions and red tape, this informational piece will give a brief description of the trails, a background of the canyon's technical climbing, and general information about the rock climbing areas.

Legend has it that Bill Forrest used to use The Wood as a practice area, though this has not been substantiated. Aside from the Colorado Mountain Club\u2019s development of The Grocery Store Wall, the technical climbing history at Castlewood is sketchy at best. Castlewood has been the practice ground for The Colorado Mountain Club since at least the early seventies. Fred Crowley introduced the CMC to The Grocery Store Wall sometime around this period or shortly before. Ken Trout did the first free lead of The Good the Bad and the Dirty on The Cave Wall in 1979. Alan Mosiman and Steve Holonich published the first climbers guide in about 1986. It included the topropes on The Grocery Store Wall. I became involved with route development at Castlewood around 1986 and this is the date that I can share first hand knowledge of climbing history within the park. We had been doing a lot of toproping, bouldering and a few trad leads up until 1986. In the mid-eighties, my brother Rob, Mark Johler, and I toproped approximately 800 lines. (We\u2019ve added about 200 more tr\u2019s since). We avoided The Grocery Store Wall and The Five & Dime Wall, as they had already been developed, and aside from a few lines on The Falls Wall, which were developed by Chris Drysdale, pretty much everything else seemed fair game. After visiting Shelf Road, right after the first sport routes were being developed there, we realized that we could do the same thing at Castlewood. Chris Drysdale put up the very first sport climbs at Castlewood. Out of Arms Reach and Arborist Arms on The Falls Wall were Chris\u2019s sport additions to the park. I put up my first sport route, Helm Hammerhand, just outside and north of The Dungeon, around 1987. Then I went on to \"sport out\" most of the quality lines that we had previously toproped that looked like they would make for a quality sport line. I was pretty much involved in all of the subsequent sport climb development from that point forward. Other coconspirators were Tod Anderson, Richard Wright, Mike Lane and Scott Sills. There are currently around 160 sport climbs at The Wood. I was involved with all but half a dozen of these. I realize that the little history that I have provided in rather inbred, but I can only relate what I have experienced first hand. I have made several queries of former CMC members and I have been unable to obtain a much cleared picture of the earlier route development.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tArea\t\t\tApprox.

The canyon is about 8.5 km long and 200m to 750m deep. It was created by the R\u00edo La Carbonera which finds its origin at Pico de Orizaba. A total of 24 waterfalls, 12 natural springs and 4 caves have been recorded and beside its nice scenery, Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de la Carbonera offers the visitor a couple of option for outdoor adventures.\r\n\r\nYou can hike into the canyon from Nogales (the most popular way to visit the canyon) or you can canyoneer the whole canyon top down, starting from the village Palo Grande. To do the latter a couple of outdoor companies in Orizaba offer their services. You\u2019ll start at 2150m and end at 1295m over a total of 8.5km which could be done in a long day, or you could camp in the canyon and make it into a day and a half. It\u2019s rated 3BRV. Ask at the Orizaba Tourism office at the town hall (also called the \u2018Palacio de Hierro\u2019) about agencies if you want to go canyoneering.\r\n\r\nIf you are hiking into the canyon from Nogales, you will hike the R\u00edo Carbonera upstream for about two to two and a half hours to an 80m high waterfall called \u2018Hilos de Plata\u2019 (or \u2018Golden threads\u2019). The name refers to the waterdrops falling down while the sun shining through them which makes it look like golden threads falling down the edge of the canyon.

From here go straight untill the little bridge. After the bridge the road becomes a dirt road. It turns left a bit, but then goes right, into the canyon. This is the neighbourhood of  \u2018La Carbonera\u2019.\r\n\r\nAfter about 5min following the R\u00edo Carbonera (on your right side) you\u2019ll see a hanging bridge across the river. 50m further ahead, the road goes goes down towards the river. I guess this could be called the beginning of the trail. To get here from the church of Nogales should be about half an hour. If you don\u2019t go down towards the river here, the road continues past a couple of houses turns into a trail that also goes towards the river.\r\n\r\nIf you cross the river right after the bridge a broad trail continues and you see a sign saying \u2018hilos de plata\u2019 on a tree on your right side after some ten minutes. Another ten minutes further, you\u2019ll walk past a farm. From here on the trail becomes more narrow and goes through the valley with lush vegetation.  There is a second sign at about one hour from the trailhead indicating the way to waterfall. From here the trail goes towards the river again.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ll cross a side river of R\u00edo Carbonera (it was dry when I crossed it in December) and after about 15min you\u2019ll have to cross the river again. There are plenty of big rocks in the river so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard and you shouldn\u2019t get wet. If you cross here, some twenty meters on the other side of the river the trail goes up and goes all the way straight to the waterfall in about 30 min. If the water would be to high at the second crossing of the river, you might lose the trail on the other side,  so even if you get wet, cross the river at the point where the trail takes you.\r\n\r\nFrom here, as you are walking above the river, you\u2019ll see the waterfall from a distance. At its foot big boulders create smaller waterfalls. When I was there in December, the waterfall wasn\u2019t that big. Like its name says, it was more like waterdrops (but then many of them) falling down into the canyon, so there wasn\u2019t really a pool at the bottom. You can continue a little bit from here.\r\n\r\nIf you continue upstream, walk under the waterfall and climbing over some boulders you\u2019ll reach the actual end of the trail in some 15 min. A big boulder with a flat vertical side marks the end, together with a cross with a photo of the \u2018Angel de la Guardia\u2019 (Angel of the Guardians). Next to the big boulder, the R\u00edo Carbonera comes down pretty steep over the rocky surface of the canyon. You can go up a little bit to a little plateau where three more crosses have been put in place. But from here on it\u2019s impossible to continue without taking big risks. There is another waterfall around the corner which is  actually the R\u00edo Carbonera falling down a steep wall.\r\n\r\n", "Location": "Veracruz,Mexico,NorthAmerica"},

Since it\u2019s a large canyon system in itself, it deserves its own page.\r\n\r\nLike Grand Gulch, Bullet Canyon is an \u201coutdoor museum\u201d and one of the best places in the world to hike for an archeological interest in a scenic and wilderness setting, rather than under a glass case in a museum in some large city. Bullet Canyon is full of Anasazi Indian ruins, as well as several earlier archeological sites. Most ruins are around 800 to 1200 years old, but some are as recent as 700 years old, and some are as old as 2000 years old.\r\n\r\nAround 1300 AD the Anasazi moved south and into the Rio Grande Valley of New Mexico. Since then, so one has ever lived in Grand Gulch, but the ruins of an ancient civilization remain.\r\n\r\nThe rediscovery of the Grand Gulch system, including Bullet Canyon happened in 1880, and several archeological parties visited the canyons between the years 1890 and 1897. Now days, it is very illegal to remove or otherwise disturb the sites in any way. Please leave the potsherds, corn cobs, and ruins for other future generations to enjoy.\r\n\r\nBullet Canyon itself is almost eight miles long, and hikes range from one day to several weeks if you are using this canyon to access others in the Grand Gulch system. There are many opportunities and variations possible.\r\n\r\nBullet Canyon actually varies from Grand Gulch in many ways.     One, vegetation and water is more plentiful.        The canyon is also chocked with boulders in the upper end, and drops much more steeply than Grand Gulch.        There are also some sections where the canyon bottom is smooth slickrock, rather than the wide sandy bottom that is the norm in Grand Gulch.\r\n\r\nSome of the ruins in Bullet Canyon also are different from any found in Grand Gulch.      In particular, there are two rim top \u201clookout tower\u201d ruins at the head of Bullet Canyon.      Perhaps they were there to look for invaders or strangers.      Unlike Grand Gulch, you can\u2019t sneak into the canyon, but would be visible from the towers.\r\n\r\nThe Perfect Kiva ruin in Bullet Canyon.", "Seasons": "Spring:\r\n\r\nMarch through May is the best time to hike Bullet Canyon. Water is usually more plentiful than in other seasons, and days are long and pleasant.

Expect hot days and little water. Hiking and camping is still possible, but not as pleasant.\r\n\r\nFall:\r\n\r\nFall (September through November) is another good time to hike Bullet Canyon, but the first half of September is usually really hot, and late November can be cold and snowy. Temperatures are similar to Spring, but there isn\u2019t as much daylight. Fall colors usually peak around mid to late October in Grand Gulch.\r\n\r\nWinter:\r\n\r\nWinter (December through February) can be pleasant if you are prepared, but the upper canyon can be cold, snowy, and icy, the route can be dangerous.

{"Routes Overview": "These are meant to be overviews only, so please see the route pages for more info.\r\n\r\nThere are two possible routes for getting into the main canyon. They are the North Fork and South Fork. The South Fork is the shorter of the two routes \r\n\r\nNorth Fork Route: From the trailhead, route-find west and contour south into the canyon. The route is 4th class, and some may prefer the comfort of a rope, but I would highly recommend that if you find yourself needing a rope, that you try another canyon. If you need a rope here, this is not the trip for you. Continue down the canyon and negtiate several obstacles. Right at the confluence of the two forks is a 24-foot drop into a swimming hole. You could rappel in, but the easiest way around is to retreat 400 feet and climb up a crack on the SW side of the canyon. This crack will lead into the South Fork. Continue down the canyon to the confluence, which is at the mentioned pool. \r\n\r\nSouth Fork Route: From the trailhead (Horse Heaven Reservoir), follow the faint vehicle track along the rim of the South Fork. You must find a route into the canyon. There are several possibilities, and all have some challenge to them. After you find a route into the canyon, follow the canyon down to the confluence with the North Fork and pool mentioned above. There is one major obstacle 2/3 of the way down the South Fork. You can pass the major drop off on the left (north) side. This is a fair challenge, but if you have trouble here, seriously reconsider heading further down canyon. \r\n\r\nNow that you are at the confluence, from either of the two above routes, you must swim the mentioned pool. Continue down canyon. Sontinue down the canyon, passing many difficult obstacles (see the route description).  This canyon requires much skill and climbing ability.  There are several swims as well.  Exit the canyon and follow the rim of the main canyon and then the South Fork all the way back to Horse Heaven Reservoir. \r\n\r\nLots of rope work is required.", "Time Needed": "This canyon will take a very long day to negotiate. We took 12.67 hours from the North Fork, but we were moving very quickly. Take a headlamp and be prepared to route-find back in the dark if necessary. You will have to do the canyon as a day trip unless you think you take a pack, which makes the climbing sections near impossible.\r\n\r\nMany obstacles are here to slow you down.\r\n", "Mountain Conditions": "WEATHER FORECAST FOR SAN RAFAEL SWELL\r\n\r\nWeather and climate data for the Hanksville is below.  *National Weather Service Data 1912-2004.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTHAVE HIGHAVE LOWREC HIGHREC LOWAVE PRECIP (in)JAN39969-35.33FEB491974-33.21MAR6027884.42APR70359810.40MAY814410723.46JUN915311031.27JUL976011438.48AUG945711035.80SEP854810524.68OCT723595-6.68NOV562282-8.42DEC441470-24.29\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "You must have a good map to navigate in this wild region.

Roads from Exits 89 or Exit 105 will also lead you to the same area. \r\n\r\nFrom Exit 97, follow the road south for about 9 miles to a four-way junction. Keep straight and follow the signs/roads to Moroni slopes. There are many junctions, but drive past Hebes Mountain and between the two Cedar Mountains on the map, and then two the Moroni Slopes catchment and Horse Heaven Reservoir.

There isn't an official campground for many, many miles from out here!\r\n", "When To Climb": "May and early June is the best time. In April you could probably do the canyon if you had a wetsuit. Summer is searing hot on the hike out through the desert, and in winter swimming through chunks of ice isn't that fun. Fall is nice too temperature wise, but this is such a long day, you would probably run out of daylight long before you got back to your vehicle. \r\n\r\nStay out of this canyon with any threats of rain. Flash floods can easily kill you if a thunderstorm is present because there is nowhere to seek high ground in the slot canyon. \r\n\r\nExpect to get wet and the water is cool most of the year.\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Do you ever daydream about a smooth and soothing hike where you can kick back in an alpine meadow or desert canyon and get some relaxation in along the way? Me neither. How about a trip that is as smooth and soothing as a punk rock concert in a hurricane? Now that's the stuff daydreams are made of! \r\n\r\nI first gained an interest in the canyon in 1995 when Steve Allen (who wrote three books on canyoneering), a well known hard-core canyoneer published a page on the upper section of the canyon. He said that to descend the canyon there is \"much bouldering-shot hard moves, class 5 climbing, and the route is a bit hairy at times; no beginners.\" It sounded all right, but that's not what attracted me to the canyon. I knew it was a really spectacular area scenery wise too, but it was a sentence near the end of the trip report that caught my attention. \"After a stretch of narrows, there is a set of beautiful potholes in a narrows that is impossible to descend.\" It was that phrase that attracted us to the canyon. (We have also speculated that often when Steve Allen says something is impossible, it doesn\u2019t mean he hasn't been there). \r\n\r\nIn the national parks, for example, we had come to learn to pick the best trips, you find the most knowledgeable ranger out there, strike up a conversation, and asked him/her if there is any where in the park that is impossible to get to. If they say yes, then our response is always the same. \"Sounds cool. Can we have a permit?\u201d \r\n\r\nFor anyone who thinks that descending a technical canyon must be easier than ascending a technical mountain, you may be in for a rude awakening. The canyon contains the same 5th class pitches (but usually shorter) that you will find on a mountain, but with a few additional obstacles. Ever tried to disconnect from a rappel while treading in ice-cold water? How about starting a climb of a short 5th class pitch while treading water? Climbing low 5th class is one thing; down-climbing low 5th class is another. \r\n\r\nDon't let all this description scare you off into thinking the canyon is a death trap. It's not, and a well-experienced climber/canyoneer will have a great time. Just go well prepared. It is important to learn skills of natural anchoring before heading into the canyon as a bunch of bolts could turn the canyon into a fairly easy class-4 jaunt. \r\n\r\nAlthough in recent years a few sport bolters have placed some bolts in the canyon (unfortunately) and sometimes leave a fixed rope or two (please don't), which has reduced the difficulty somewhat, the canyon is still a challenge. \r\n\r\nDescriptions on getting there and of the route are intentionally brief. You must know how to read a map well, and be well versed in navigation before heading into this wild area. \r\n\r\nRapping into a pothole in Cable Canyon.", "Clean Canyoneering Ethics": "The canyons in this area are very pristine. Bolts are not needed to descend this canyon, and would detract from the incredibly pristine setting of this slot canyon. There were no bolts in the canyon at the time of our descent, but since then, some low-skill climbers have placed some. Please keep it as natural as possible by not placing bolts. There are plenty of chockstones to wrap slings around for anchors. It would be best to use a retrievable sling system, but if you don't have any experience with this, leave a short sling behind at every drop. Try to leave as little behind as possible.

The North Fork of the Virgin River runs south from Navajo Lake at 9200 feet elevation, 11 miles to Chamberlain Ranch, 5900 feet elevation, where the top-to-bottom through-hike of The Narrows begins. Covering all 16 miles will lead you through a varied terrain of beautiful multicolored rock, blue-green water, an occasional spring or waterfall, and vegetation made to seem greener by its rarity. The river here at Chamberlain Ranch is really a small stream bordered by forest and meadow, which continues west until a gorge starts to form within 2 miles. From here until the confluence with Deep Creek, passing into Zion National Park in the process, 8.5 miles from the Chamberlain Ranch, the walls grow to reach up to 1300 feet, sometimes only ten to twenty feet apart. The combined river then turns south where the wall height becomes continuous for quite a distance. The gorge from here down has vertical sandstone walls from 40 to 100 feet apart, with occasional pockets of forest on both sides. From Deep Creek to Big Springs, an obvious oasis of vegetation and cascading water is 2.7 miles. At Big Springs, the canyon narrows again, and the true Narrows begin. For most of the next 3.6 mile stretch to the Mouth of the Narrows, the river runs wall to wall, often requiring wading and swimming. A mile south of the Mouth of the Narrows is the Temple of Sinawava, where the river enters Zion Canyon, a flat-floored, quarter to half-mile wide canyon with steep sandstone mountains on each side, their summits towering above. This is where day hikers venture north into the Narrows for a stunning, albeit abridged glimpse of the beauty within.

The whole area is also very suitable for hiking and biking.\n\nFrom the continental part, be it in Italy or in Slovenia, no river or creek is flowing down into the Adriatic. All sources come out below the land step, and then flow across Istria. But there is one exception - the creek of Glin\u0161\u010dica is having its sources below Slavnik mountain, 1028m, and is then flowing all the way down, until in the Bay of Trieste/Trst it inflows into Adriatic sea. The valley of Val Rosandra / Glin\u0161\u010dica is thus the only valley cutting the above mentioned barrier and hosting also a nice creek.

A true multi-ethnical group, great friends despite of, and against fascism which was raging at that time. Let me write here just one idea, attributed to Comici.

In the canyon Canyon scenery Want to ride?  \n\nA great climbing area\n\nhaubi - on a climbThe list of named and described climbs is long and consists of some 400 titles! Most of the routes are short, from only 10 meters to some 80 meters. And even if most of them are not very hard, some also harder ones can be found The range of routes difficulties varies from UIAA 3 to 8b. In the alpine history, the climbing area of Val Rosandra / Glin\u0161\u010dica is most known by the name of the famous Emilo Comici. This great climber of the 20th century did a lot of hard climbs in Alps, but was training in his home valley of Val Rosandra / Glin\u0161\u010dica. Still today a side ridge and a rocky peak in it carries his name - Cima Comici. So in a nice day on almost every rock, every tower and avery crag people are hanging, giving a visitor an expression, that in Trieste/Trst just everyone does some climbing now and then. Here is the link to the list of most climbed routes in Italian (thank you, Fabrizio!).

In the upper part of the valley, where you can find short steep walls, members of CAI Trieste made three quite demanding ferratas. They are used mostly for training purposes and to gain experience on such routes. Looking up these are:\n Rose d'Inverno (Winter Roses), in the left wall,\n Naso (Nose), in the left wall,\n Via Bruno Biondi, crossing the entire right wall.\nA nice creek, gorges and a waterfall\n\nIn the gorge\nGabriele - Exceptionally you can do even ice climbs\nThe upper part of the creek, till the settlement of Botazzo/Bota\u010d, is unknown to me. There still seem to be some rocky structures and perhaps the creek also there offers some picturesque scenery. But the part below Botazzo/Bota\u010d is definitely very nice and picturesque area. Soon below the settlement, there is a landmark of Val Rosandra / Glin\u0161\u010dica. Some 40 meters high waterfall does not have allways much water, but is usually worth visiting. In times of heavy rainfall the waterfall is one of the most beautiful natural phaenomena in the vicinity of Trieste/Trst.\n\nJust below the waterfall, the creek enters wonderful gorges. The abysses above the water are not very high itself, even if the rocky slopes there do form a real canyon, but the river bed is so nicely cut in the limestone bed. Calm ponds and winding creek flows are intermitting, if you come around in spring (let's say in April) or in autumn, also the surrounding nature is very picturesque.\n\nInstead of hiking up the valley by the broad main path it is highly recommended to take the scramble by the river bed. As early as possible start scrambling, if the water is high also wading in some parts, until you reach the waterfall. There you exit  on the left (orographically) side of the creek, where the main path goes. Otherwise tiny paths are going mostly on the other, right part of the creek.  The creek The waterfall Wading  \n\nPanoramas\nThe edges of the surrounding plateaus are reaching altitudes some more than 400 meters. From them, you have very nice views, especially on the town of Trieste/Trst and its surroundings. We took two times an opportunity to be there in the time of the famous \"Barcolana\" race, where some 4000 sails vessels are racing on the sea, just outside Trieste/Trst. You can admire an endless number of white spots on the sea mirror, as if by some wonder snow would cover the bay.  Socerb panorama A. Vega - Socerb panorama  \n\nBiking tours\nWhile the path through the valley is reserved for hikers, bikers are using the course of the ex railway. It ascended from Trieste/Trst, over the slopes of Val Rosandra / Glin\u0161\u010dica reached the point above Botazzo/Bota\u010d, and continued on the Slovenian territory, coming out at Kozina. That is a nice challenge for mountain bikers, who can then return by ordinary roads. Also over the neighbouring plateaus many mountain bike routes lead.  Below the biking track  \nCultural Heritage\nThe remains of Ancient Roman aqueduct were already mentioned. The second nice landmark is the cute church of Santa Maria. As in previous centuries through the valley a frequented path went inland, above the path people built even before the 13th ventury a modest church.

The 3,600 acre monument is situated about 7 miles east of Flagstaff and it protects a portion of the 20-mile long, 400-foot deep canyon containing 700 year old Sinagua cliff ruins.  There are two trails here that you can take.  One is just a stroll along the top of the canyon and one takes you down a steep staircase into the canyon.  Here you will can walk right up to and beside ruins that are remarkably well-preserved because they were protected from the elements under rock alcoves.  \r\n\u00a0Arizona Black Walnut\r\nWalnut Canyon is also unique because of the variety of micro-habitats it contains.  It is known as a biological \"hot spot\" for the abundance and variety of plant and animal life that live here.  The canyon serves as a migratory corridor for animals traveling between the lower elevation pinyon-juniper woodland to the higher elevation pine forests.\r\n\r\nGeology is also a fascinating thing to observe and study here.  It took Walnut Creek 60 million years to carve the canyon out of sandstone and limestone.  Today not much water flows through the canyon due to the impoundment of Walnut Creek as a source of water for Flagstaff residents.  In rare floods the water from the creek joins the Little Colorado River en route to the Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nWalnut Canyon National Monument was established in 1915 specifically to preserve the ruins.  Before its National Monument status it was part of the San Francisco Mountain Reserve (later the Coconino National Forest).  It was named after the Arizona or Black Walnut Tree (Juglans major) that grows here.  The walnuts were an important part of the Sinagua diet.

It then starts switchbacking up the south ridge. At mile 2, the trail turns east again as it heads to Rudy's Flat.

The first few miles you will pass some canyons which are tributaries to Orderville Canyon including: Birch Hollow, Walker Gulch and Esplin Gulch. Be prepared for obstacles and be aware that obstacles can change after a flash flood rearranges things. The first obstacle should be a large boulder that can be down-climbed through an opening on the side. When the water is flowing this can be scary for some since you have to climb through the water. I have seen so many groups of people jumping from this rock and others in the group terrified because they don't want to jump but do not know how else to get down. Please don't jump, Zion's SAR team would appreciate it. There have been terrible injuries in this canyon due to jumping. Learn to down-climb and bring a rope for the obstacles that cannot be down-climbed by members of your group. After passing the large boulder and continuing down stream you will pass Englestead Hollow and Bulloch Gulch. After this last side canyon there will be several obstacles to overcome.  Either down-climb them or set up short rappels as needed.  The last obstacle should be the moqui steps on the waterfall. This is a slippery place to down-climb. Please set up a rope!  You are almost to the Zion Narrows at this point. Once you are at the Narrows you have hiked 8.5 miles through Orderville Canyon. Continue through the Narrows, then down the Riverside Walk and get on the Zion Canyon Shuttle. If you do this canyon after the shuttles close for the season you will be able to park your car at the Temple of Sinawava.  If you are not an experienced winter canyoneer, please do not attempt to do this route during the colder months of the year when a wetsuit and other gear and knowledge may be essential.\r\n\r\nBest Time to Go\r\nMid-June to mid-September when the water is warmer. Any other time of the year check to see what the water temperature is. You might need a wet/drysuit.\r\n\r\nGear - Bring a 60 foot rope, rapelling device, neoprene socks, a dry bag and wear appropriate water shoes and quick dry clothing - not cotton.  Never jump in these canyons! Use your rope and do not go unless you have some down-climbing skills.\r\n\r\nHi-Tech Clothing - The hi-tech shirts have probably become the most popular form of this type of clothing, often stocked in large department stores amidst regular clothing. The various types of hi-tech clothing are not only comfortable but they are light to wear and to carry so you can dress in layers and then toss into your pack what's not needed. The fabric wicks moisture away from skin and dries quickly which can be essential when hiking in cold weather. You will find the apparels quick dry properties essential in canyons where drying quickly can become essential to staying warm.\r\n  \r\nSafety - Orderville Canyon looks like a water park to some, but jumping and horse-playing in the slot canyons can and has resulted in serious injuries. Check the weather before going. Never enter a slot canyon when it's raining at the location or upstream from where you will be hiking. Most canyons offer no refuge in the event of a flash flood. Do not think you can out run one or climb to safety. Sticky rubber shoes are essential for canyoneering. Carry enough water for the trip and wear quick dry clothing such as hi-tech shirts and shorts.  \r\n\r\nRemember - You are responsible for your own safety.

Orderville Canyon is among the most used canyons in the park due to its beauty, but also because, like the Subway, advanced canyoneering skills are not required. Still you will need solid down-climbing skills along with some simple rope work knowledge. This canyon is often considered to be \"semi-technical\" rather than technical. You will be wading in cold water and expect to do some swimming. Even if you do this in the summer, neoprene socks make the hike more comfortable. There are obstacles that can be down-climbed but most people will need a rope to navigate the canyon safely. You will also need basic canyoneering gear such as sturdy water shoes, dry bag, a rope and a rappelling device. The canyon begins outside of the park boundary, dropping into Zion where it begins to form a narrow slot.  This is one of the prettiest slot canyons in the park, with vertical walls several hundred feet high. The canyon ends when it butts into the North Fork of the Virgin River, not far from the end of the Zion Narrows Route.  After you finish Orderville Canyon, you get an added bonus as you wade into the Zion Narrows out to the paved Riverside Walk Trail that leads to the Temple of Sinawava and the end of Zion Canyon. Many hikers like to use ski-like hiking poles to keep their balance once they are in the Zion Narrows due to the increased water flow compared to that in Orderville Canyon.

Ordesa, West is the most famous of them (with A\u00f1isclo, Escua\u00edn and Pineta).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAbout Ca\u00f1\u00f3n de Ordesa\r\n\r\nSurrounded by three-thousander peaks and vertical cliffs more than 1000m high, Ordesa is one of Europe's largest canyons, sharing this status with Montenegro's Tara, Greece's Samaria, or Iceland's J\u00f6kuls\u00e1rglj\u00fafur . Some may also add to this list Alp's Gorges du Verdon, some deep valleys of the Dolomites, Norway's fjords, and so on, if we consider only the deepness...\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nBut here is where Ordesa makes all the differences, this is probably the only canyon in Europe with a real shape of \"canyon\", as we imagine them in Colorado, Brasil, or Texas. Perfectly vertical, steep, square-shaped.\r\nThe explorator Franz Schrader, in the 19th century, who painted many aquarels of Ordesa, wrote in one of his books : \"Ordesa is the only place in Pyrenees which reminds me of the canyons in South America\".\r\n\r\nIn the old times this place was sometimes called \"Valley of Arazas\" (after its river Rio Arazas), or \"Arasas\". It was a famous place for Ibex hunting, and was the are were the last Pyrenean ibexes (a characteristic race, different than the alps) were recenced in the 80's, before this race disappeared.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nOrdesa is also an area where can be found in abundance the Ramonda pyrenaica, an endemic plant specific to this region, and named after the botanist Louis Ramond de Carbonni\u00e8res, the first climber of Monte Perdido 1802.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOrdesa is about 7-8 km long, oriented upstream from West to East, and curves towards the North in the final part. It has 2 secondary branches, respectively Circo de Carriata and Circo de Cotatuero on the North side.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOn the final part, a serie of little waterfalls, called Gradas de Soaso, are one of the most sceneric parts of the trail going on the bottom. \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nA trail goes along the South rim (\"Faja de Pelay\") with breath-taking views overlooking the abyss. It is from here that the views are the most spectacular, since you watch the highest cliffs in the same time than all high 3000m peaks of the area.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOn the northern hillside, many trails are located at different levels on flat parts between vertical section of the cliffs. There are 2 of such trails linking Circo de Carriata and Circo de Cotatuero, plus one between the top of the rim and the high peaks of the border. The second is the most vertiginous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn the Circo de Cotatuero are also located the \"clavijas de Cotatuero\", a \"via ferrata\" before the invention of this word, made of metallic bars set on a vertical part, only possible way to go through, and not advised for those who suffer vertigo. They were set here a long time ago to allow british hunter Mr Buxton to access his favorite hunting grounds.\r\n\r\nCirco de Carriata also have some \"clavijas\", but much easier than Cotatuero. (here and here, some pics provided by Luiso)\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOne of Ordessa most well-known spots is the \r\nTozal de Mallo, a jagged excentred prominence of the northern cliffs. On the canyon side, it is perfectly vertical; on the wall-side, accessible on foot from the trail of Circo de Cotatuero. This is a very famous rock-climbing spot.\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=42.64810&amp;distance_lon_9=-0.06042&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">42.64810\u00b0N/0.06042\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "Sep1,2008/Apr21,2009", "Location": "Huesca/Sobrarbe,Spain,Europe", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Ordesa is a national park, so you cannot pick up flowers, disturb animals, make fires, leave rubbish, etc.\r\nGoing offtrails is not forbidden but at your own risk.\r\nThe rules concerning camping/bivouacquing are a but unclear.

The trail is well maintained and the creek is mostly bridged (with varying materials and effectiveness).  The verticals aren\u2019t particularly steep but the climb is a steady uphill hike the whole way.  \r\n\r\nThe entire hike is forested and is a good summer evening hike. It is generally kid friendly and there are few places where the little guys could get hurt.  The best time to hike the canyon (or anywhere in Utah) is fall.  This area in particular has great leaf changes.  The trail is very snowshoeable during the winter but it looks difficult to Nordic Ski.  The trail should be pretty good during the spring run-off, although some of the creek crossings may become challenging.   Most research articles on the trail advertise it as a brutal, skill-testing bike ride and advise starting from the top on the ridgeline road and doing it as a downhill bomber run. \r\n\r\nTHE HIKE\r\n\r\nThe hike through the canyon starts at the Holbrook/Sessions Trailhead, located just across the street from the Bountiful LDS Temple.  The trail goes down the hill from the trailhead to the creek bed. The trail then turns east and is easily followed as it winds through the canyon next to the creek.  Along the way there are numerous splinters off the trail but they invariably hook up to the main trail making it difficult to get lost.   The forest is thick on both sides of the trail and rarely pops out onto bare hillside.  The first big landmark is at about 1.5 miles where the trail crosses the creek in an area with some unique rock formations and there is a nice primitive camping spot shielded by a cliff and boulders.  From there, the next big landmark is the pipeline clearing which crosses the trail and goes steeply up the hillside.  The trail continues to wind through the canyon until it reaches the ridgeline road.  \r\n\r\nOverall, the trail is well maintained but crosses the creek at least a dozen times.  Most of the time that is not a problem, but it might be sporty during the spring. You may have to rock hop or ford in places. \r\n\r\nHIKE INFO:\r\nTrailhead Location:  40.881682,-111.844318\r\nTrailhead Elevation:  5,160\r\nTurnaround Elevation 6,250\r\nDistance Trailhead to Canyon end:  ~3.5 Miles\r\nHike Time:  4 Hours\r\nVertical Gain: 1,090\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Nov24,2012/Nov24,2012", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica", "Getting There and Red Tape": "\u00a0Trailhead sign\u00a0LDS Temple Near Trailhead\r\n\r\nGETTING THERE  \r\n\r\nThe trailhead is located at 40.881682,-111.844318.

Strong hikers will find it easy, but casual hikers will likely find it grueling, especially in hot weather.  It is a good idea to avoid this hike from June through August, but the canyon is accessible year-round, excepting temporarily impassible road conditions due to snow or heavy rain.\n\nFrom the trailhead, where Horseshoe Canyon does not appear especially spectacular, hike down the well-maintained trail to the floor of the canyon.  About ten minutes from the trailhead, on the left side of the trail, are two dinosaur prints (from different animals) embedded in the rock.  These tracks are anywhere from 50 to 100 million years old.  Talk about the Fountain of Youth, or at least the Rock of Feeling Younger!  The larger and more obvious one is of a three-toed creature, and it is wide enough for you to put your entire hand inside the \u201cpalm\u201d of the print.  A photograph of this print on the sign at the trailhead may help you spot it.  I do not have a picture of it because I felt that capturing a good image would have required filling the print with enough sand to show the outline, depth, and breadth; and I felt that would have been cheating.\n\nIt is about 1.3 miles from the trailhead to the canyon floor, and you descend over 500 feet to get there.  From the floor, look for a trail winding upcanyon.  You can follow the canyon floor all the way to the Great Gallery, but you may miss some of the other art sites if you do so.  Both the cairned trail and the bed of Barrier Creek offer easy hiking in most conditions.  Either way, head right.  You can probably find wonderful seclusion if you go left, but you won\u2019t see any rock art.\n\nThe first site is about 0.5 miles upcanyon, high and left.  Almost directly across from it is the second, Horseshoe Shelter.  Next, about another half-mile upcanyon, is the Alcove, where there is nice Archaic art but, sadly, true vandalism, too.  Don\u2019t let that diminish your enjoyment of the hike; a worthwhile prize does await.\n\nAlmost four miles from the trailhead, hikers will finally come upon the Great Gallery, the highlight of the canyon.  Park Service Rangers may be present, and if they are, hiking up and into the alcove sheltering this unbelievable place will mean going up there with them.  Understand that they are there to educate visitors and enhance their experiences but that they are also there to protect this special and incredibly vulnerable place.  Whether the rangers are there or not, DO NOT TOUCH THE PAINTINGS!  Viewing the figures up close gives one a sense of being in the presence of the people who lived here and sharing a moment of their lives, but the figures actually look better from a distance, as they seem to take on a three-dimensional aspect.\n\nJust beyond the Great Gallery are some dinosaur tracks preserved in a streambed, but as of 2006, they were buried under sand and impossible to locate.  A storm could come through and change everything again, but you probably won\u2019t know unless you go and look for yourself.\n\n", "The Great Gallery": "\u00a0\nBy the photohiker\u00a0\nBy the photohiker\nThe Great Gallery, like the other sites in Horseshoe Canyon, contains Archaic paintings created between 2000 and 8000 years ago.

There are dozens of human and animal and possibly spiritual figures here, and the artists used an astonishing variety of colors derived from ground minerals mixed with some type of liquid base\u2014the predominant theory is that the base was from animal tallow or the juices from vegetables (water would not have worked in such an arid environment).  Now, the base is gone, but the minerals\u2019 colors remain.\n\nThe Great Gallery is often called the Louvre of the Southwest.

In fact, before I beheld such places, one could have heard me dismiss them as graffiti.  After all, what would people call it if I walked up to a rock wall, scratched an image of a bird on it, and walked away?  \u201cVandal\u201d would just be a euphemism in that case, wouldn\u2019t it?  And so I felt for a long time, most likely because I associated appreciation of rock art with crowds of people who went to the wilderness to see the handiwork of man, something bewildering and antithetical to the very idea of wilderness to me.  An unfair assessment, yes, but nevertheless what I felt.\n\nAnd then something just piqued my interest and out there I went.  And it was more than beautiful, more than amazing.  I lack the adjectives for it, in fact.   As I stood in the exact spot where some visionary stood thousands of years before, I felt surrounded by the spirits and the power of the past.  There is something about such places that makes one step softly and speak in hushed tones, and so I did.  I cannot explain exactly why.  Reverence?  Respect?  Fear?  Awe?  All I know is that I couldn\u2019t stop gaping at not just the magic in front of me but also at my stupidity for dismissing it so arrogantly, so cavalierly, for so long.  Now, I still have no love or interest for the canvas works that hang in museums or private galleries, but I rave about the wonders among the walls of the Southwest, and I encourage, implore, those who haven\u2019t seen them to go and those who have to spread the word to others, others they feel can appreciate them.

Ultimately\u00a0the East Fork joins with the San Antonio River at Battleship Rock to form the\u00a0Jemez River, which anchors the southern end of the Jemez Mountains. Along its\u00a0length, the Jemez River and the East Fork have created some spectacular sights\u00a0including the famous Soda Dam and Jemez Falls, and long been a destination for\u00a0small-stream trout fishermen. Designated as a wild and scenic river, the East\u00a0Fork of the Jemez is a high-country gem.Hidden along the length of the East Fork are various small\u00a0canyons carved out of ancient volcanic tuff. The best, and most well-known, is\u00a0the East Fork Box. This popular destination is a short 3-mile roundtrip hike to\u00a0a \u00bc-mile long slot canyon filled with pools, a waterfall, and steep walls of\u00a0eroded volcanic tuff. On warm summer days, there are always people here wading\u00a0and swimming in the various pools.\n\nThe American Canyoneering Academy rating for this canyon\u00a0would be a 1B I meaning that the\u00a0canyon is non-technical, has a small current with possible pools to wade or\u00a0swim, and only takes a few hours to complete. As with all canyons, please\u00a0remain aware of the dangers of flash floods. Do not attempt to hike this canyon\u00a0when there is any rain in the watershed.\n\nEast Fork Box Map\nFrom the roadside parking, drop down from the eastside of the road into the East Fork\u00a0drainage. From here, follow either the shallow river upstream, or the sometimes\u00a0vague trail that parallels the stream. Either way, your feet are going to get\u00a0wet! Come prepared with sandals, water shoes, or old sneakers you don\u2019t mind\u00a0getting wet and sandy.\nAt first the river winds its way through a gentle valley\u00a0with grassy meadows. Soon though, cliffs start to intrude. At some of these\u00a0points, you will be forced to navigate the streambed.\n\nEntrance to the Box\nWooden Bridge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point, the river makes a big horseshoe bend to the\u00a0north. There used to be a bridge across the river here, but it is now gone. On\u00a0the southside of the stream is a signpost and trail sign marking a trail over\u00a0the spur of the hill. The horseshoe bend is technically on private property.\u00a0There used to be a fence and signs asking people not to trespass. The\u00a0appropriate solution was to take the trail over the hill as a bypass. But on\u00a0current maps, it appears that the forest service has worked out a solution with\u00a0the owner, and it is now possible to continue in the river and follow the\u00a0horseshoe bend.\n\nOnce past the horseshoe, the river continues on for another\u00a0several hundred yards until you hit a wooden footbridge. This bridge marks the junction\u00a0of the official East Fork trail with the river. Continuing upstream, the East\u00a0Fork Box will appear in about two hundred yards. At that point, the canyon\u00a0immediately narrows, opens up, then narrows again. Keep your eyes peeled for\u00a0floating rocks. These pieces of volcanic tuff have trapped air.

Another option is to surmount the\u00a0cliffs to the northeast and drop down into the slot from above. In previous\u00a0years, the pools in the canyon were deep enough to jump into from the cliff\u00a0walls. Recent flash floods have filled in the pools with gravel.

The normal trail starts at the fee station, zigzaging down into the canyon. This route described here will use that trail in the end.\r\n\r\nFrom the Belvedere parking area our route leads back to the intersection with SP 4 road. Turn right and follow the SP 4 for about 1 km. Don\u00b4t worry too much traffic, the thing you should worry about on this road is the blasting sun ....\r\n\r\nAfter 1 km you reach an intersection, take the right dirt road which leads down into a gentle valley with some farm houses. Stay on this road, pass the farm houses - if there is a dog advancing menacingly, menace it too by picking up a stone and aiming at it - the dog will retreat. If there are 5 or more dogs advancing together - you will retreat :-) No, just kidding ...\r\n\u00a0The \"Amphitheater\" (25-06-2005)\r\nThe road turns right, then left, passes another farm house. Directly after this farmhouse turn right and left again and enter a rocky plateau. Go straight on, you pass some ruins and a lonely garage and you arrive the rim of the Cassibile canyon.

There is a sort of an aqueduct in the rock with a path. Follow this path, it is on the south side of the creek and a little above it. The path might be overgrown and full of thorny twines - can be a little \"Via Dolorosa\" but never mind. A good hike requires always a good portion of suffering, too.\r\n\r\nThe creek created two wonderful sinuosities and the path meanders with them. The second one, a sort of a natural amphitheatre is just beautiful. There is a path down to the creek and a pond. If you visit this place don\u00b4t get too much tempted to strip your clothes off - the best is yet to come ...\r\n\r\nAfter the second amphitheatre the trail will become better. Just follow it straight on - there are other, sometimes better looking trails which descend or ascend - don\u00b4t use them. The trail moves up and down and offers stunning new views every 50 meters. \r\n\r\nAfter a while you see a huge cavern in the rockface on the other side of the canyon, the so called Grotta dei Briganti, the robber\u00b4s cave. There are rock tombs of ancient cultures carved in. The tombs and the caves were used in later times as shelter places when there were pirate attacks or during wartimes.\r\n\u00a0Traversing \"Amphitheater\" (25-06-2005)\u00a0The Grotta dei Briganti (25-06-2005)\r\nAt last you reach the intersection with the trail coming down from the Belvedere parking place.

It is described in the below mentioned guidebook, too. \r\nNevertheless there are some plates along the decribed way into the canyon indicating that entering the canyon is forbidden. They weren\u00b4t very precise about that, though. As far as I understood them this has nothing to do with the \"Riserva Naturale\" and a maybe stronger protected part of the parc which should not be entered by hikers. Maybe the electricity company does not like having hikers as visitors. But if you stay on the trails you will not disturb anybody.\r\nSicilian people are very friendly especially if you try to talk to them. I taked to several people at the farmhouses while descending to the valley. Nobody told me that it really is forbidden to take this route. \r\n\r\n"},

The whole of the hike through the canyon has a wilderness feel despite being next to Centerville and is a good afternoon diversion away from the city.  Over the course of the hike, Centerville Canyon has diverse terrain including steep rocky areas, river crossings, waterfalls, and thick forest.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the hike is steep/rocky west facing mountainside. Since it is exposed to direct sun for most of the day, it is hot and dry. The trail continues into the canyon and steadily becomes more forested as you go.  After reaching the creek in about \u00be miles, the canyon narrows and is shaded by thick forest.  At this point, with Centerville Creek running nearby, it is about 10 degrees cooler than in town. Fall season hikes net some nice leaf changes and fall coloring within a few minutes of Centerville.  Spring time can be kind of tricky as the creek gets swollen with snow runoff and the trails stay iced into late April.  Centerville Canyon is also a good snowshoe destination for winter hikers.  Nordic skiing is probably out of the question unless you are highly skilled. In general, the canyon has low hiker density and most days you will have it to yourself. \r\n\r\nThe trail starts south of the Centerville\u2019s Parrish Lane Trailhead, next to the water reservoir about \u00bc miles down the dirt road.  There is a small trailhead marker with a map.  From there the trail goes steeply up the hill for about \u00bc mile continues up the side of the canyon to about 4950 feet. After about 1 mile, the route reaches Centerville Creek. The trail then continues to gain altitude, but not as steeply, as it winds through the canyon and crosses the creek numerous times. \r\n\r\nThe trail continues through the forest until reaching a 40 foot waterfall. Beyond the waterfall, the trail gets wilder and much more difficult.  The brush is thick and the trail ill-defined\u2014you can see where someone has gone, but it\u2019s a serious bushwhack. \r\n\r\nSome local enthusiasts volunteer to improve the trail and there are primitive bridges, pre-built fire rings and even a rope swing along the trail.  The route up to the rope swing is kid friendly (although the 1st part may be tough for little ones).  \r\n\r\nOverall, the trail to the waterfall is straightforward with only a couple of divergent paths. The first divergence is early in the hike when the trail starts to get less steep and goes up the side up the mountain. It is obviously less traveled and will take you to Zigzag Hill (6470).  A second divergence is at the creek junction and it\u2019s where the North and South Centerville Canyon trails meet. There a few other much less obvious side trails along the route.  One interesting side route involves some steep YDS 2 hiking and will take you up to the flag pole with Old Glory sitting on a rocky crag high above the canyon. Nice views there and great place to lunch.  From there you can also climb out of the canyon and continue up to Zigzag Hill on the YDS 2 route. \r\n", "Red Tape And Camping": "\u00a0Primitive Camp...pre-built and ready to use!\u00a0Primitive Camping sites dot the area\r\n\r\nRED TAPE\r\n\r\nNone.

They also close at different times, but all are closed from December through March.\r\n\r\nBackcountry camping is prohibited in almost all of the Whiteoak Canyon-Cedar Run corridor.

Far from being unknown or even seldom-visited, Cedar Run nevertheless offers a welcome, delightful escape from the crowds that flock to the canyon just over the ridge to the north.\r\n\r\nThe trail through the canyon is memorable enough on its own, but SP members, many of whom like a little more adventure to their hikes, can find cliffs and boulders here in abundance.  Numerous short gorges accessible only by leaving the trail beckon.  When winter is cold enough, ice climbers can practice their trade on the frozen waterfalls and ice-coated cliffs they will find here.  Wildflower and fall foliage enthusiasts will find endless subjects to explore with both their eyes and their cameras.  Wildlife is always close by, though the popularity of the area makes sightings of the park\u2019s signature species, the black bear, quite unlikely.", "Route": "I believe in experiencing Cedar Run from the bottom up for two reasons: the best parts are in the lower half of the canyon; and a trail network cuts across from the top of the Cedar Run trail to just above the upper falls in Whiteoak Canyon, enabling what might be the most spectacular loop hike in the East that doesn\u2019t climb mountaintops.  The route up Cedar Run climbs 3.3 miles to Skyline Drive at Hawksbill Gap; going by contour lines, the climb is 2200\u2019, but ups and downs add more.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe trail is well-maintained, but because it is so steep, rocky, and/or slippery in places, I call this a Class 2 route.  But if you are doing the loop, going up Cedar Run is safer than descending it, and the link to Whiteoak Canyon is mostly downhill.  Trekking poles or stout hiking sticks may be helpful.\r\n\u00a0\r\nAbout 0.2 miles from the trailhead, the Cedar Run Trail branches off left (south), climbs a hill, and soon crosses Cedar Run--- this crossing is almost always very slick and sometimes deep.  For the next mile, the trail climbs steeply while passing three significant waterfalls, all of which are best viewed after some steep, slippery off-trail scrambling.  Although Cedar Run is generally smaller than Whiteoak Run, there are still many scenic cascades and pools.  After passing the brink of the upper falls, the trail crosses Cedar Run again, and the canyon widens and the cliffs soon disappear.  Cedar Run remains within sight and/or sound almost all the way to its upper end, but in dry seasons it can be little more than a trickle.\r\n\u00a0\r\nSome people training for longer, harder climbs or who just want a combination of mountain vies and waterfalls on the same hike ascend Cedar Run, cross Skyline Drive at Hawksbill Gap, and then hike to the summit of Hawksbill, the park\u2019s highest point.  This adds about 1 mile and 700 vertical feet to the hike (one-way).  Please see the attached route page for more details.\r\n\r\nAnother great option is to hike the Cedar Run-Whiteoak Canyon Loop, one of the finest loop hikes in the park and in all the East (see attached route page).\r\n\u00a0", "Created/Edited": "Feb13,2007/Oct17,2010", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=38.53820&amp;distance_lon_9=-78.36350&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.53820\u00b0N/78.3635\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "To enter Skyline Drive, you must pay an entry fee and receive a seven-day permit.

This collection occurs mostly on weekends in spring, summer, and fall, but be prepared anytime.

On sunny weekends in spring through fall, the parking lots at both trailheads will be crowded and may even fill. This is particularly a problem at the lower end since you cannot park along the road. The crowds will also guarantee no peace and quiet and may even affect your ability to take good pictures.

The thing that makes the Chamber of the Basilisk so unique is that the slot canyon disappears into a hole in the ground!\r\n\r\nIf you are in the area of Goblin Valley and Hanksville and want an incredible route without a punishing approach, this may be the route for you.  \r\n\r\nDoing the full route requires technical gear, but you can get into the lower end of the chamber without it.\r\n\r\nThe Story Behind the Name:\r\n\r\nOn May 14 2011 my son Kessler and daughter Shaylee (this was to be their birthday trip as Shaylee turned 7 and May 4 and Kessler was to turn 9 on May 17), my wife Kimberly, coworker Justin and I were going to go do Crescent Creek slot after exploring Little Egypt. The weather forecast said hot and dry, but the skies were dark, cloudy and it looked like it could rain. We decided not to do a slot canyon and headed for Goblin Valley to do some exploring.\r\n\r\nWe explored around a bit and climbed a highpoint and explored around the mini-slot above the chamber. We didn\u2019t bother taking ropes (I\u2019d never taken them to Goblin Valley before) and we got to a drop which we weren\u2019t sure if we could climb back up so I was thinking maybe we should come back with ropes and see what\u2019s down there sometime. We didn\u2019t expect too much, but it might be a cool place to kill sometime.\r\n\r\nOn October 16 and during the Bogley gathering Scott (a different one), Brad, Kessler and I checked out a \u201cnew route\u201d at White Roost Canyon (funny story). After seeing that we didn\u2019t have enough time to reverse the \u201cnew route\u201d and complete the standard route, I mentioned that there was this mini-slot in Goblin Valley (which was more or less on the way home) that I thought would only take a few hours. Brad and Scott were going to drive home instead, but last minute they decided to check it out with us.\r\n\r\nThis time we took a little wrong turn and ended up too far south, but we climbed a butte for some nice views and headed for the little slot. We followed the mini-slot down canyon and it just disappeared into a hole in the ground(!). We didn't expect anything like this. It didn't drop into a crack or a narrow slot, but just a hole. It was kind of intimidating to just look into a deep and dark black hole in the ground since we couldn't see what was down there or if you can get out of it. \r\n\r\nI tied a kid\u2019s pack onto the rope and tossed it down to see if it would hit bottom. It did and after measuring the excess rope, we figured that the \u201chole\u201d was ~90 feet deep. Brad, the other Scott and I still wanted to see what was in the hole so we all decided that we would descend it after we helped Kim and the kids back to the head of the canyon so they could safely return back to the car the normal way. \r\n\r\nWe would all wait at the top of the hole though until someone rappelled down with ascenders to make sure that the route continued. We weren\u2019t sure if the route was doable. Brad volunteered for the job and nervously rappelled into the hole. On the way down he yelled \u201cI see light\u201d, but he wasn\u2019t sure if he could climb out of the Chamber to continue the route. When he got to the bottom of the Chamber he walked to the other side and made sure he could climb out the other side. He then yelled up that he could climb out and urged us to come down. Before we would drop into the hole though, Scott and I got ready to escort Kim and the kids back out of the slot canyon to Goblin Valley proper when seven year old Shaylee said \u201cI want to go down down the hole\u201d. It was a longer drop than they had ever gone down at the time, but we decided to let them. Shaylee had a huge smile (caught on camera) while descending into the hole.\r\n\r\nWe all rappelled into the hole and found that it opens up into this huge spectacular underground chamber. There were some huge holes in the ceiling so you don\u2019t need a headlamp. \r\n\r\nAfter admiring the chamber we exited and headed back. It was an awesome route and took us four hours (including all the exploratory time, tossing the pack down, measuring, etc.). We discussed names, but the kids wanted the name Chamber of the Basilisk named after the giant snake in Harry Potter and for the huge \u201csnake hole\u201d you rappel into to reach the chamber from the top. \r\n\r\nOn November 13 during the North Wash gathering, several Bogley members were looking for a short canyon to do on the way home. We volunteered to show the canyon and the kids were really eager to show off the place (since they felt like they pioneered the route). There was a pretty big group of us (all the people in the video) and we drove to the trailhead. With the kids usually leading the way and since we knew exactly how to get there now, we went straight to the entrance and down in. It was all done very efficiently and we all completed the route in ~two hours car to car. \r\n\r\nAnyway, a moral to the story might be that no matter how well you think you know a place, there can still be features that you have missed and still room to explore. I\u2019ve been going to Goblin Valley with my parents and siblings ever since I was a small child. My wife and I have been going since we knew each other and we\u2019ve been taking the kids since they have been very tiny as well. The chamber was sitting right there under our noses for all these years before we got to see it. I thought there wasn\u2019t much more to see in Goblin Valley that I already haven\u2019t seen, but (as has been the case with some other areas as well) I was wrong. No matter how well you think you know aplace, there is always room to explore, including in places you\u2019ve walked right by for years.\r\n\r\nPopularity \r\n\r\nIt's amazing how quickly an obscure place can turn popular.   Chamber of the Basilisk is already a very popular destination, despite the fact that nothing was ever published on it until very recently.   After we took them through, some people started calling the place Goblins Lair, but I prefer the name Chamber of the Basilisk.

Its trail can also be used for attempting Mt Ogden or Malan\u2019s Peak by climbing the rocks to the right of the waterfall and following the trail up the side of the mountain. \n\nThe most common way to reach Waterfall Canyon is from the 29th Street Trailhead located (41.210624,-111.931978) for a 1.37 mile hike to the falls. Inexplicably, the trail to the waterfall is rated as \u201cdifficult\u201d on most websites, but is actually a \u201cmoderate\u201d YDS Class 1 hiking trail. Total elevation gain to the waterfall from Ogden is ~1,200 feet and takes 45 minutes one way for medium hikers from the 29th Street Trailhead.\n\nThe first half of the hike up to the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST) from the 29th Street Trailhead is a steady rise up the side of the hill past scrub oak and sage brush. Once at the BST there is a small bridge and the trail splits left/right/up the hill. Left and Right are for BST; Waterfall Canyon is the rocky center trail. Continue up the canyon on the beaten path through the forest for about a \u00bd mile. The trail is loaded with rocks and a real ankle breaker if you aren\u2019t careful. As you approach the Waterfall, you will hear it long before you see it. Near the waterfall, there is a small stream to cross and then the trail goes sharply up to the waterfall. The waterfall, in and of itself is a pretty destination\u2026you just don\u2019t see too many 200 foot waterfalls in Utah. Grab a rock, take a break, and return the way you came. \n\nTrue professionals can climb the rocks to the right of the waterfall and continue to a second waterfall. The trail can be part of a loop that crosses Malan Basin/Peak, down Taylor Canyon to 27th Street and back to your vehicle on 29th Street. You could also follow the trail high up the mountain and summit Mt Ogden. \n\n\nSummer is the worst time to visit the Waterfall. In addition to being hot, the lower trail is crowded with mountain bikers and slow, noisy hikers. On summer evenings the hike is a virtual conga line of teenagers, retirees and guys taking their girls on cheap dates. \n\nWaterfall Canyon is a good winter destination and you can climb it with or without snowshoes. You will most likely have the canyon pretty much to yourself and it becomes nice, quiet, short winter hike. \n\nThe cliffs above the waterfall are popular climbing destinations but can be dangerous. There is a small, informal shrine near the waterfall dedicated to a teenager who fell and died climbing the cliffs in 2010. The waterfall partially freezes in a huge sheet during the winter and makes the waterfall scalable for ice-climbers. Winter hikers should use caution next to the waterfall as ten pound chunks of ice routinely fall off and can brain you where you stand. \n", "Red Tape and Camping": "\u00a0\nTrail from 29th Street\u00a0\nThe Waterfall as first seen from the trail\n\nRed Tape:\n\nThe trails are on a mix of\u00a0USFS,\u00a0and/or private property (TR Guest Ranch) property.

Turn right and immediately turn right again onto Wagon Train Road, which is old Route 66. Pass the McDonald's and drive to the end of the road. You will find a historical marker erected in 1917 and dedicated to the pioneers of the Santa Fe and Salt Lake Trail. \r\n\r\nAcross the road, notice the wooden sign identifying the Pacific Crest Trail, which is cut into the north side of the narrow canyon. The original Indian footpath from the desert to the Cajon Pass was in or near the creekbed below and it is along this creekbed that Jefferson Hunt entered the region on two separate expeditions. \r\n\r\nAbout 50 yards up the Pacific Crest Trail are the remains of the concrete support for a bridge built in 1914. You'll also notice two types of asphalt on the trail. The darker underlying layer was put down in 1909 as a 9-foot-wide wagon road. The road was widened in 1914 to 16 feet and the lighter colored asphalt is the remainder of that road. Both overlaid the original dirt toll road built by John Brown in 1861. \r\n\r\nBrown's first tollhouse sat about halfway up the canyon. \r\n\r\nBlue Cut - Old Route 66 \r\n\r\nExit southbound Interstate 15 at Cleghorn Road and turn right onto Cajon Road, again old Route 66, and head south. After about a mile, the road diverges from the interstate, heading west toward a large bend known as Blue Cut. Drive past the picnic area, and look for a safety wall constructed of rock. \r\n\r\nThis wall was built in 1931 as part of a two-lane widening project for Route 66. At the southern end of the rock wall, erosion has revealed areas where two layers of blacktop can be seen. The top is from the 1931 road, the lower layer is from a section of road built in 1916. Look across the creek and you will see an arched railroad underpass with the numbers 654 over it. \r\n\r\nJohn Brown's second tollhouse sat just south of this underpass, on the far side of the creek. A sloping line rising along the hill to the north is the original wagon road. Looking across Route 66 and to the south, you can see a line of trees. \r\n\r\nThese mark the course of Cajon Creek before it was rerouted for the 1931 road project. \r\n", "Camping": "Closest campgrounds would be at Lytle Creek (either Applewhite Campground or the nearby yellow-post sites) or Silverwood Lake State Park. ", "Overview": "\n            Cajon Pass is a major canyon that separates the San Gabriel Mountains from the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California.  Owing its existence mainly due to the San Andreas Fault which slices up through this region, Cajon Pass is a natural thoroughfare that has been used for tens of thousands of years.  For those interested in history, there is no shortage of it here!  \r\n\r\nThe Cahuilla and Serrano Native Americans called this region home for a long time.  They had a huge camp called Muscupiabe where the modern day Hwy 138 and I-15 meet.  Then the explorers came through - the Mojave, Santa Fe, Spanish, and Mormon Trails all converge here.  In 1885 the Santa Fe Railroad was completed through the pass.  Then came automobiles.  The first paved road that came through in 1916.  Soon after the Old Trails Highway came through, later relocated and widened and renamed Route 66. Route 66 opened up Southern California to the rest of the US.  It was later renamed to State Hwy 91 and then eventually Interstate 15. Many traces of the old roads and railroad beds and stations still exist.    \r\n\r\nToday about a million cars travel through the pass on I-15 every week, beating out I-5 with record numbers of vehicles per day moving north and south through California.  And the now three railroad lines comprise what may be the busiest railroad freight corridor in the world.  \r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn addition to the fault, Cajon Creek, old trails, old roads, the extremely busy modern highway, and the railroad, there are three sets of high voltage power lines that are aligned through the pass, high pressure gas lines, and jet fuel lines that go through the pass.  And, oh yeah, the Pacific Crest Trail crosses the canyon and goes underneath the freeway near the truck weighing station.  \r\n\r\nWhew, yeah, this is a busy place! The convergence of all these things, plus interesting weather and the chaparral hillsides being prone to wildfires, make this place insanely busy.  But, the good news is the business is concentrated along the freeway and railroad corridor in the main canyon.  If you explore its side canyons and bordering high peaks you'll probably have them to yourself.  There are a lot of interesting things to discover in this important part of Southern California.  \r\n\r\nMy favorite time in the pass is spring - March through May - when the wildflowers bloom.  This year (2010) it's been a particularly nice year for the lupine and bush poppies.  \r\n\r\nLocals know the entire canyon from Devore up to Oak Hills as \"Cajon Pass\" even though geographically it's probably best described as a canyon.  \"Cajon Summit\" is the high point of the pass at 4,190', or where the northbound lanes of I-15 crest the edge of Baldy Mesa and enter the High Desert.

The upper part of Waterholes Canyon lays on the Navajo Reservation above the rim of Glen Canyon. The lower sections empties out into the canyon to the Colorado River, which is part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. In 4 miles, this canyon drops 1500 feet through the Page Sandstone (a lateral variation of the Navajo Sandstone )in Glen Canyon. \n\nWaterholes is an amazing canyon for numerous reasons. One is that it looks almost like Antelope Canyon, which is only 8 miles away, but the lack of crowds make Waterholes alot nicer. It is also a very technical canyon. While you don't have to build your own anchors, there are 15+ rappels (depending upon how you count them). Lots of stemming is required with some impossibly narrow sections. Swimming is required in a few sections as well. Then the coolest thing, the crux- a 300 ft rappel over featureless sandstone. If you do this rappel, then you are committed and have to float the Colorado River to Lees Ferry for 4 miles or catch a ride on a boat somehow.\n\nIf you are an avid canyoneer, just getting started, or looking for photo opportunities minus the crowds, there are options for you. Waterholes Canyon is divided into three sections: Upper, Middle and Lower. Upper Waterholes is very photogenic and offers easy hiking with a little bit of climbing. Middle Waterholes offers around 5 rappels and is often the location of many canyoneering classes. Lower Waterholes has the \"Big Drop\", the 300ft rappel it also has swimming sections along with the narrowest section of the canyon.\n\nWhat to Bring: No technical gear is needed for Upper Waterholes. A small rope might be useful for one section (see route beta). For Middle Waterholes, bring a 60m rope, rappelling gear, helmets, and extra webbing. For Lower Waterholes, bring two 60m ropes, helmet, lots of webbing, dry bags, wetsuits (would be helpful earlier in the year), headlamps (there are some dark sections, but you can get by without), ascending gear, personal anchors and lots of food and water. We brought inflatable kayaks and paddles into the canyon- I really don't recommend a repeat of that. Be sure to bring a knife too. In many parts, especially on the big rappel, there is lots of old webbing and rope. If you bring a knife you can cut away these \"rats nests\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGoogle Earth breakdown up Waterholes Canyon\u00a0\nElevation Profile of Waterholes Canyon (not entirely accurate)\n", "Created/Edited": "May19,2011/Nov14,2013", "External Links": "\u00a0\nStemming over some water\nCurrent Weather Conditions\nThe current weather for Waterholes Canyon as provided by NOAA.

He have good information about Upper and Middle Waterholes, but his information about Lower Waterholes is very vague.", "Route Beta": "Upper Waterholes- 2A II\n\nUpper Waterholes is the least technical section of this canyon. Upper Waterholes is considered anything above Waterholes Bridge. Although these are the least technical sections of the canyons, there are some of the most photogenic. To get into the canyon, you have to walk about about a quarter mile along the rim. Cairns dot the trail here and there. Once in the canyon, you can either hike upwards or go downwards towards Middle and Lower Waterholes. If you're just here to hike Upper Waterholes, then I would recommend checking out something called the \"Great Wall\". The Great Wall has some amazing cross-bedded sandstone outcrops above the canyon that almost look like the Wave. These are located about .50 miles from the Waterholes Parking area. If you are looking to do Lower and Middle Waterholes, just head down canyon. However, if you are here for the upper section, there are some things you need to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe Great Wall\u00a0\nWaterholes Bridge\n\nFrom top to bottom- A large wash sits above the slot canyon part of Upper Waterholes and it gets narrow pretty fast. These are some tall, photogenic slots in here. There is some downclimbing/climbing to be done here. There are a few tight sections that have slopping dry falls. One of them is fairly hard, but with another person there to assist you, it can be climbed or downclimbed fairly easy. This section then ends and opens up into a wider part. Then, the canyon becomes quite narrow- the narrowest parts of Upper Waterholes. The winding slot continues for sometime and then you reach a 15ft slopping dry fall. One could just slide down, but its a little high to do that. We used a meat anchor (just wrapped the rope around someone and put them around the corner of the canyon). Once we were down, the other person slide down while we spotted. The canyon from here on is still pretty tight for a few and then opens up again to the part where you would enter if you were doing Lower/Middle Waterholes. Parts of this section could have water, but if there is, its only enough to get your feet wet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe only technical part of Upper Waterholes. Its pretty easy\u00a0\nFluted Walls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMore photogenic sections in Upper Waterholes<\u00a0\nBeautiful, but deadly/td>\n\n\nMiddle Waterholes- 3A II-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Updated 11/14/13 to reflect current conditions!\n\nMiddle Waterholes, as said before, begins after the Waterholes Bridge. The first difficulty is just after the bridge and its downclimbing from the wedged car under the bridge-its just awkward. The going is a little easier after that as you walk the narrow slots that open and close repeatedly. \n\nRappel 1 is around 20 feet. It is kind of awkward because two sets of bolts have been cut. Now, there is a single bolt standing up directly over the rappel and you just have to rap the bolt with your rope. As you go down, make sure tension stays on the rope otherwise it will come off. The two times that I have been, there was a dinky yellow rope in place. After this rappel, the slot opens and closes up again. The going is still pretty easy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLooking down rappel 1. Don't use this rope. Just wrap your rope around the bolt.\u00a0\nLooking Up Rappel 1\n\nRappel 2 is the biggest rappel in Middle Waterholes. Its a good idea to bring a personal anchor for this because the bolts (on your left) are perched right on a sloping ledge over the drop off. This rappel is around 60ft (18m) and is overhung. Water could be at the base of this rappel because its a small keeper pot hole. The first two times I did Middle Waterholes there was moisture/mud, but no water. The third time (November 2011) it was filled to the brim and was a swimmer. If this is the case, you can avoid it if you want!!! Instead of doing the 60ft rappel in the canyon proper, you can hike out to the right to an alternate set of anchors. There is one set higher up that if you use them, you have to veer to the canyoneers right to another set of anchors on a nice platform (30ft). From here, its around 85 feet to the bottom. Once again, I would only use this rappel if you are trying to avoid the keeper pot hole when its full of water. \nUpdate: The keeper pot hole at the bottom is now about 13ft deep! (2.5 m)! It is very hard to escape! A pack toss or pot shot is needed to get a rope up there. There is lots of mud in the bottom too making the task of getting out even harder. I would almost just plan on doing the alternate rappel on canyoneers right to avoid this (no update on the anchors for that rappel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRappel 2\u00a0\nLooking up Rappel 2\nRappel 3 is a short rappel soon after rappel 2. The anchors are higher up on the wall on the right. An personal anchor might be good here. This rappel is only 25ft.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nLooking at rappel 3\u00a0\nBack towards rappel 3\n\nRappel 4 is a fun rappel and the last rappel in Middle Waterholes. The canyon opens up dramatically at this rappel. You walk out on to a small ledge hugging the canyon wall. Large bolts and hangers are on the wall on the right. This rappel is around 25ft on a sloping wall- you can go really fast here. The rappel used to be around 40ft, but floods in the summer of 2103 made this drop shorter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nSetting up Rappel 4-this flake directly in front is now gone. It was washed away in floods during the summer of 2013.\n\u00a0\nDown Rappel 4\nUpdate: There are three more rappels after rappel 4 as of 11/14/13. The first one is above where the \"cruxy\" down-climb used to be. It is a massive chokestone with webbing around the pinch point between the boulder and the wall. This one is around 20 ft (6 m) high. The next is a two stage, 25 ft (7.5 m) drop that is fairly difficult to rappel. Webbing is found on a small choke-stone (unnerving) on the left. Something needs to be down to improve this anchor (deadman?). After this, the canyon takes a 90 degree turn to the left and a 10 ft (3 m) climb is required to get to the top of the next drop. This drop is about the same height, 10 ft (3m) and can either be down-climbed or rappel (using bolts on canyon left). The canyon opens dramatically right after this and takes a sharp right.\n\n\u00a0Shortly after this is the escape route out on the right. You can't miss the route-its the only way to get out of this lower part and its pretty obvious. Cairns mark the route up. If you reach another set of narrows and potholes you have gone to far, stop! (unless you are doing Lower Waterholes). Some parts are pretty loose so be careful of rock fall. The crux of the climb out comes towards the top. There is a decent amount of exposure and there is a piece of webbing to aid your climb in this spot. The climbing doesn't exceed low 4th class. After this, you pop out on the top of the canyon. Just follow the canyon rim east and you will eventually reach Waterholes Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe harder downclimb-now gone! This is the first part of a rappel. Where the guy with the blue backpack is standing is now 8ft down and then there is another 10 feet below that. Updated 11/14/13\n\u00a0\nThe photogenic section towards the end. This is now replaced with a large pile of debris and requires a ten foot climb to get to the top of the third new rappel. Updated 11/14/13\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nWhere Middle Waterholes opens up. The escape route is right around here\u00a0\nLooking back down from atop the escape route at Lower Waterholes\nLower Waterholes- 4B IV (if doing Middle Waterholes)\n\nThis is now the point of no return. Committing to this section is an arduous undergoing. From here, you have hard down climbing, a 300ft multi-pitch rappel (or single rappel if you have a 300ft rope), and you have to float the Colorado River for 4 miles to get to Lees Ferry. You can leave your ropes and jumar up on the return. Make sure you are properly equipped to do this section!! \n\nFrom the escape route out, head up on to the cliff bands above the slot. You could follow the slot in this place, but its a little faster to bypass this section due to a keeper pot hole and some awkward climbing. Cairns indicate when you enter into the canyon again. This section requires lots of stemming. There are bolts in one spot to prevent one from failing in a huge keeper pot hole that is some 20 or so feet deep. Shortly after this, the canyon gets very very tight and drops around 25feet. This is the narrowest canyon I have ever been in. There is hardly enough room to squeeze through. This part looks daunting at first, especially with the drop, however, stemming here is pretty easy. There is no way you can keep your pack on and there is hardly room to even pull it through. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nKeeper pot hole at the start of Lower Waterholes. Its pretty easy to get out of, but in the sake of time, its best to avoid it\u00a0\nFixed webbing to help avoid a very deep keeper pot hole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nEntering the bowels of Waterholes-the narrowest section of Waterholes Canyon\u00a0\nSqueezing through the tightest part of Lower Waterholes\nRappel 5 is an easy rappel of about 15 feet. Bolts are found just above the rappel on the right (?). Some people downclimb it, but I think it iis better to rappel it. It was really dirty when we were there with mud from floods, which would make downclimbng somewhat hazardous. Shortly after this, there is a small, natural arch with a slopping downclimb into it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nDirty Rappel 5\u00a0\nThe downclimb into the Natural Arch\nThis is the part of the canyon where you get to get wet! The canyon stays narrow after this and one has to deal with a waist deep pool. We had one friend that was able to stem over it, but most of us just gave up and went through it. Another water section ensues. On this one, everyone might get wet. This was about chest deep and pretty cold. Once again, one of friends was able to get through without getting wet, but it was a work of art to say the least. Another water section comes right after this one. On this one, at least one person has to get wet. There are bolts on either side of this deep pool (you have to swim if you go in the water and it is cold!). We rigged up a little zip line to cross, which worked out wonderfully. After this one, the canyon begins to open up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nStemming over the first pool\u00a0\nComing to the second pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nGetting Wet in the second pool\u00a0\nComing to the third pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMe on the zip line\u00a0\nLooking back at the zip line and the third pool\nRappel 6 comes right after this last pool. The bolts are up on the right side of the wall close to the ledge. In order to get there, you can either hug the little ledge with your toes or slide into a little curved dryfall. At least one person needs to go on the ledge to get to the anchors. Once the anchors are set up, that person can then lower themselves down with a little handline and start the rappel. This rappel slopes along a dry (sometimes moist) 50ft wall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe top of rappel 6\u00a0\nLooking back up at rappel 6\nRappel 7 comes right after Rappel 5. This is the top part of the big rappel. If you plan on ascending your ropes back to the escape route, don't do this rappel!!! The bolts for this rappel can be found on a block on the right overlooking a narrow slot. This rappel is tricky because it is in a whirling, tight slot. This rappel is around 60 feet. Important: stay on rappel at the end of rappel 7. The bottom of rappel 7 is very, very tight and there is hardly any room to move. The big rappel starts here!! In this very tight section, there is an array of bolts, pitons and other anchor gear. Don't even use them!! Stay on rappel and go over the ledge to a set two bolts with alot of webbing. If you do this, rope maintenance will be alot easier and you will be able to re-direct your ropes to avoid the rope eating crack! The only downside is that these hangers are just over the lip of the big rappel so you have 300ft of exposure below as you hang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe top of rappel 7\u00a0\nThe narrow part of rappel 7\nRappel 8 (first rappel of the multi-pitch) is a difficult rappel because one has to contend with the rope eating crack. Your probably thinking \"oh I can avoid it\"...good luck. While hanging on the previously mention anchors, make sure your ropes are in order (this is where you need to tie the two 60m ropes together!). We had poor rope maintenance and almost lost our ropes. What works better is to have the first person go down and feed the ropes out (you can do this by coiling the rope on a webbing, in a rope bag or in your pack). If you drop the ropes from the top, they will end up in the rope eating crack one way or another and then you are screwed. This rappel is 150ft. There is a little bulge maybe 130ft down and if you look right (canyoneers right), you will see some plants growing in the middle of the wall and a bunch of bolts and anchors. You now need to do a pendulum over to those anchors-its easy. Or you could just veer right as soon as the rope eating crack ends. This is another hanging belay. \"Hang out here\" until you partners join you. Be very careful pulling your ropes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nOn the top anchors on the big rappel\u00a0\nLooking down from the top of the big rappel\nRappel 9 (second rappel of the multi-pitch) obviously comes directly after rappel 8. Once again, using good rope maintenance, redirect your ropes and set up this rappel. This rappel is around 180ft and is fairly easy. The bottom is a little overhung and you just have to lower yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMid-Wall Anchors\u00a0\nMid-Wall view\n\nA few pointers about the big rappel... Leave yourself a big chunk of time to do this rappel, it takes awhile. A good idea is to hang your packs with webbing off of your harness. If you don't, then you will be exhausted by the end of this rappel because it takes alot of effort to support your weight and your packs weight while hanging or rappeling on a big wall. Have no more then 4 people for this part! Having more then 4 people on these anchors is a big hassle and makes life alot harder. Everyone in the group needs to have third hands. Some people have done the big rappel with one rope (see the link for  \"Latest Rave Canyoneering\"). Also, there is said to be another route to the climbers left of the big rappel that enables one to only use one 60m rope. You can see some of these anchors up on the wall still, but I don't have good beta for that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAt the top rappel station\u00a0\nOur party at the top rappel station and at the mid-wall rappel station\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBig Rappel from the bottom<\u00a0\nBrian lowering himself down on the last part of the Big rappel\nRappel 10 is about 100 yards past the big rappel.

The upper one is between mileposts 42 and 43 along Skyline Drive, the paved road running north-south through the park.  To get there from Luray or Warrenton (both in Virginia), take U.S. 211 east from Luray or west from Warrenton until the road crests the Blue Ridge and intersects the Thornton Gap entrance of Shenandoah National Park (this is about 40 miles from Warrenton).  From the entrance station, where there is a fee (see RED TAPE), head south.  Just past the second turnoff for the Skyland resort, look for a large, marked parking area on the left side of the road.  This is the trailhead.  People arriving from the south can access the park at Rockfish Gap between Waynesboro and Charlottesville or at Swift Run Gap between New Market and Ruckersville; then drive north to the trailhead.  People arriving from the north can enter through the park\u2019s northern entrance by Front Royal and then head south.\n\nThe lower trailhead is more remote.  At Sperryville along U.S. 211, look for signs indicating 522 and 231 and follow the directions to them.  Turn right on 231.  You can also reach 231 via 522 from Culpeper, and you can take 231 all the way from Charlottesville.  After about 10 miles along 231, you reach a tiny town called Etlan.  Look on the east side of the road for a small convenience store.  Directly across the road from the store is SR 643.  There should be a sign indicating access to Whiteoak Canyon.  Follow this road for about 4 miles  until you reach a stop sign.  Turn right (a sign for Whiteoak Canyon should confirm this).  You are now on SR 600, and it takes you all the way to the signed parking area and trailhead, almost at the very end of the road.  Instead of turning into the parking area, continue straight for about 0.8 mi to the end of the road, which is where the Berry Hollow Fire Road begins.  It is about 5 miles from the junction of 643 and 600 to the trailhead, and the drive takes about 15-20 minutes.\n", "Camping": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCamping options for Whiteoak Canyon are not very good.  Big Meadows is about 10 miles south on Skyline Drive, and it fills most weekends from May through October, so arrive around noon when campers check out and sites open.  Half the sites are reservable through the National Parks Reservation System (see park link below).  There are three other developed campgrounds in the park, but they are all at least twice as far from Whiteoak Canyon as Big Meadows is.  The campgrounds open in April, but they do not all open at the same time.  They also close at different times, but all are closed from December through March.\n\nBackcountry camping is prohibited in almost all of the Whiteoak Canyon-Cedar Run corridor.  Private campgrounds outside the park are too far from the trailheads to make reasonable places to stay.\n ", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\n\u00a0\nShenandoah National Park is the jewel of the Blue Ridge, and Whiteoak Canyon is the jewel of Shenandoah.  Scenic hiking, technical climbing, and even swimming and ice climbing await here, and it is a place for all seasons.  Spring features full streams and a weekly progression of wildflowers.  Summer offers respite from the heat and humidity of the East and invites hikers to dip into the clear, cold pools along Whiteoak Run.  Autumn shows vivid foliage, the last of the wildflowers, and migrating butterflies (butterflies also abound from mid-April through the summer).  Winter yields solitude, quiet, clear skies, and ice-adorned cliffs, and during especially cold spells, the waterfalls freeze over and the ice on the cliffs is thick enough for climbing.\n\nA trail winds and climbs through Whiteoak Canyon.  No other trail in Shenandoah National Park offers as much as this trail does, and it ranks among the great day hikes in all the national parks of the United States.  The principal lure of the trail is its waterfalls-- there are six major ones along Whiteoak Run, several smaller cascades, a seasonal fall on the canyon\u2019s south side near the third fall, and another fall shortly upstream on Negro Run from where it crosses the trail just below the sixth fall.  The sixth fall may be the most scenic because of its twin cascades, but each fall has its own charms.  The fourth and fifth may be the most enjoyable since they are hard to see from the trail and are thus in relatively secluded settings.  The falls are not the entire story, though\u2014the entire stream is one of Shenandoah\u2019s prettiest; dripping, moss-coated cliffs rise directly from the side of the trail in places; and old, beautiful trees tower in the limited level areas while smaller trees cling to steep hillsides and cliffs.  And I did mention those wildflowers and butterflies?  Sharp eyes will notice the other insects of the area and will spot the reptiles and amphibians, too.\n", "Created/Edited": "Sep28,2006/Jan20,2014", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=38.54030&amp;distance_lon_9=-78.34970&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.54030\u00b0N/78.3497\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Route and Gear Information": "Route\nFrom end to end, the Whiteoak Canyon Trail is about 5.2 miles long. It is easy to moderate between the upper end and the first fall, and many people starting from Skyline Drive make that section their hike (RT about 5 miles). The trail is quite steep, sometimes rocky, and often slippery between the overlook of the first fall and the base of the sixth. Between the base of the sixth and the lower end of the trail, the hike is mostly easy. Although a lot of people starting from the bottom hike to all six falls and back (RT about 6 miles), quite a few just go to the sixth and back (RT 3 miles), still a very nice hike in itself.\n\nExcept for late fall through early spring, when the leafless trees allow more visibility, the fourth and fifth waterfalls are hard to see from the trail. The easiest way to get to them is to look for an unmarked use trail going toward the brink of the sixth waterfall. From there, it's a short trip to the fifth fall and then to the fourth, but it can be difficult and dangerous climbing out from the fourth fall without taking on cliffs or a moist hillside that considerate people will want to avoid damaging. For most people heading upcanyon, it would probably be better to retrace the way they took until they reach the main trail again.\n\nThe Whiteoak Canyon Trail also links up with the Cedar Run Trail (Cedar Run drops through a canyon paralleling Whiteoak to its south), and the approximately eight-mile loop here makes a spectacular hike even better (see the attached route page). Cedar Run Canyon is steeper, narrower, and more rugged than Whiteoak is, and it boasts four waterfalls of its own plus a quieter setting. The Whiteoak Canyon trail system also connects to other trails that will take one deeper into Shenandoah\u2019s backcountry.\n\nA great and pretty easy hiking trip would be to leave cars at both trailheads and hike from top to bottom. This would require at least 60 minutes of driving between each trailhead, though.\n\nEssential Gear\nSturdy hiking boots with good ankle support-- I see many obviously inexperienced hikers out here going in sandals and tennis shoes, and they are just asking for an accident.

Currently, the fee is $15, but some parks have recently raised entrance fees.  If you are paying cash, carry at least $20 to be safe.\n\nAt the lower trailhead, there is a fee of $5 per person to hike the trails.  This collection occurs mostly on weekends in spring, summer, and fall, but be prepared anytime.  An Annual or America the Beautiful Pass covers up to 4 people.\n\nAnnual passes are available and a good idea for people who visit the park frequently but don\u2019t do much other travel to national parks.  The pass was $30 the last time I noticed.  The America the Beautiful Pass is available, also.  If you plan on visiting several parks within a year\u2019s time, this pass is a great bargain at $80; it provides admission for you and all in a vehicle with you to all U.S. national parks and other federal fee areas on Forest Service, BLM, and Fish and Wildlife Service lands for one year.\n\nArrive early on weekends or go on a weekdays.  On sunny weekends in spring through fall, the parking lots at both trailheads will be crowded and may even fill.  This is particularly a problem at the lower end since you cannot park along the road.  The crowds will also guarantee no peace and quiet and may even affect your ability to take good pictures.  Starting at or shortly after dawn will make for a much better experience.\n\nShenandoah is black bear country.  You are unlikely to see any bears in the Whiteoak Canyon area, but you should still take proper precautions, especially with how you store food in the car.  This is also raccoon country, and the raccoons can be quite adept at breaking into coolers and stealing food.  Just lock all food in the trunk or in a covered area in the car, close your windows, and lock your doors.\n\nTo reduce poaching, Skyline Drive is subject to closures during hunting season.

{"Routes Overview": "Approach Routes to Outlaw Park:\r\n\r\nThere are three approaches to the base of the climb that will be discussed here.     See the route page for more details.\r\n\r\nOption #1\r\n\r\nThe easiest but the longest of the three approach routes is the one down Red Rock Canyon.      Old cattle trails can be followed for much of the way down canyon to the Yampa River.     Once the Yampa River is reached, you can follow more game paths down the river to Outlaw Park.\r\n\r\nOption #2\r\n\r\nAnother route, slightly shorter than the one above is to hike cross country from the Bench Road to the big bend in the Yampa River north of the mouth of Red Rocks Canyon.     You can scramble down to the river at the end of the point.\r\n\r\nOption #3\r\n\r\nThe most direct way to the base of the climb is to head to and climb down the gully to the river.   This is the most difficult route, and a very hot one when coming back out.\r\n\r\nOption #4 \r\n\r\nOption #4 is yet another option.      It is the same as option #3, but comes in from the rim to the north and is equally difficult.     The advantage is the views it provides, but it is a very rugged and strenuous route.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best route is option #1.    See the Approach Map for more details.\r\n\r\nApproach Routes to Outlaw Canyon:\r\n\r\nOption #1\r\n\r\nThe Key Saddle Route is the most practical route into Outlaw Arch Canyon if you want to climb Outlaw Peak on the same trip.    It is also the best route to use if you want to expore the west fork of the canyon.\r\n\r\nOption #2\r\n\r\nThe Bighorn Sheep Couloir is another route, but ascending up the canyon wall to the east before contouring around to descend a route into the east fork of the canyon.    This is the best route if you want to descend the east fork.\r\n\r\nCanyon Descent\r\n\r\nThe Key Saddle Route into the Outlaw Canyon is reasonably easy (comparatively) once you know where it is.    There is still some exposure and much scrambling.     Luckily, the hardest parts of the route aren't too exposed and the exposed parts of the route aren't too hard.\r\n\r\nThe Bighorn Couloir is rugged, but easy to find and follow and you can't get lost.   There is loose rock and you might question the sanity of the four legged animals that use this route to access the rimlands.\r\n\r\nOnce in the canyon, you will descend it to the river.   This requires some technical downclimbing as well as rappels of natural anchors, a few of which might be intimidating.

I would suggest doing something like Longs Peak instead.\r\n\r\nBriefly put: To get to the trailhead drive to the park headquarters of Dinosaur N.M., which is a few miles east of the town of Dinosaur, CO (Dinosaur is located on Highway 40 just east of the Utah border). Drive north on the Harpers Corner road for north until the Echo Park Road (gravel) takes off to the right (east). Drive the Echo Park Road to a junction.

This area of Colorado, without question, has the most remote peaks and canyons in Colorado and almost certainly even has some un-climbed peaks and untouched canyons. The peaks are incredibly spectacular and almost completely ignored, despite the fact that it offers some of the best scenery in the lower 48 states. Over a dozen very inaccessible peaks invite exploration. Only a few of the more accessible peaks are on Summitpost, but there is enough exploring here to keep one busy for years.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of spectacular canyons here as well.

There are literally dozens of seemingly completely unexplored slot canyons in the area. \r\n\r\n\u201dOutlaw Canyon\u201d (not to be confused with Outlaw Arch Canyon, which is an entirely different complex) is the name we have given to this canyon because Outlaw Park is the nearest named feature (besides the Yampa River).     The canyon is seldom descended and we almost certainly made the first traverse through the canyon in September 2006.\r\n\r\nPutting these routes up is one thing I have been working on and off for the last three years. A route from the north proved too rugged and impractical. A route from Mantle Park didn\u2019t work out. There were a few more trips that ended without finding any viable routes to access the area. Finally in April 2006, we climbed the point on the south side of the river for a good close up view of Peak 6489 and the canyons surrounding it. We got off track and just happened to spot the couloir that would be the key to the lower part of the route. The upper part of the route was discovered mostly by accident when looking for routes into the nearby canyon. The obscure route up to \u201cKey Saddle\u201d proved to be the key that unlocked the door to accessing the nearby canyons.\r\n\r\nIn all my years of exploration in the area, I have only run into people in Jones Hole and Harpers Corner. The rest of the area is very little known. I\u2019ve found one cairn, no hikers, and no footprints in all my years of traveling here, even on holiday weekends.

Though relatively few have heard of it, it is the birthplace of wilderness protection.  After spending time as a forester in the area Aldo Leopold began to recommend the protection of the Gila region as a primitive area, to be left free of development.  At his urging, the Forest Service designated it a wild area in June of 1924.  At the time the Gila encompassed over 700,000 acres.  The protection of the Gila Wilderness set the precedent for the Forest Service to establish protections for regions with wild or primitive characteristics.  This culminated in 1964 with the passage of the Wilderness Act.  Today, the Gila Wilderness contains 558,014 acres.  It is separated by a single 4x4 road from the 202,16 acre Aldo Leopold Wilderness.  Together, this 760,000 acre wilderness complex is one of the greatest and most historic backpacking destinations in America.  \r\n\r\nThe West Fork Canyon is in the heart of the Gila Wilderness.  Its headwaters flow off the east side of the Mogollon range, a series of 10,000 foot peaks that form the western boundary of the Gila Wilderness.  It continues for nearly forty miles before reaching the confluence with the Middle Fork at the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.  The Middle Fork Canyon is nearly as spectacular as that of the West Fork, although it lacks the abundance of the unique rock formations that are the hallmark of the West Fork Canyon.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to spectacular scenery, the West Fork Canyon also has fascinating historical significance.  Ancient cliff dwellings are found in the canyon walls, in addition to the incredible ruins found at the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument.  Chiricahua Apache used to make this land home.  Indeed, Geronimo claimed to have been born at the rivers headwaters.  The observant backpacker will also notice a grave marking the final resting place of a man murdered by a bandit in the 1880\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThe canyon walls are composed of a unique volcanic rock that ranges from pink to red in color.  The rock manifests itself in columns of various shapes; sometimes appearing as spires while at others it resembles melted wax.  The rock is very reminiscent of Pinnicales National Monument in California, which is a well known climbing destination.  It may be that the cliffs of the Gila could provide some outstanding routes in a unique, beautiful and wild location.\r\n\r\nThe river itself is not large in this portion of the canyon, but it is a perennial stream.  It meanders through the canyon, hugging wither side of the walls as it flows.  The vegetation is a mix of riparian and conifer forests.  The West Fork Trail follows the river for over 30 miles.

All the different rock layers are all bent up at an angle and some are fantastically twisted and deformed. Intersecting the rock layers at right angles are slot canyons, only one of which is named, Owl Canyon. This area reminds me a bit of the San Rafael Reef in Utah but on a smaller scale. There are fossils out here as well so the amateur paleontologist would have a great time looking for evidence of life from the Miocene Epoch more than 5 million years ago. Mastodons, camels, and flamingos used to roam around out here...\n\nCurrent plantlife out here is sparse - creosote and yucca, a few wildflowers in the spring, and that's about it.

It definitely counts as an inverse mountain but also consists many named and distinct mountains within its walls. It is 120 miles long and up to twenty miles wide with depths up to 800 feet and is considered by many to be the second largest canyon in the country (second of course to the Grand Canyon). It is also largely significant because it is the only thing that would interest a climber for several hundred miles around. Because of this flocks of tourists head to the canyon in the summer to camp, hike, ride horseback and explore this scenic wonder. \r\n\r\nPalo Duro Canyon is located at the edge of the Llano Estacado (staked plane) a huge, barren plateau that covers large parts of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The canyon is literally a huge hole in the ground and driving up on it from the west (see below) across the Kansas flat Llano it is hard to imagine that the canyon even exists. You almost have to fall off the dge to know that it's there. The Prairie Dog Town Fork of the Red River flows from the Llano and has slowly eroded this huge canyon. It is intereting to think that such a small stream with such a long name has carved such an impressive canyon. Wind and water continue to erode the canyon and have carved into what it currently is. \r\n\r\nThe scenery is in many ways reminsicent of the red rock canyons of Utah with even more color. However the canyon is composed not really of rock but compressedd layers of dirt. Because of this climbing on the canyon walls is very dangerous and not recommended. The colors are layered and usually follows the pattern of red at the bottom leading up to yellow and purple leading up to orange and white. It is indeed some of the most colorful \"rock\" that i've seen anywhere. \r\n\r\nThe canyon is actually a system of canyon that join together to form a large canyon heading out to the horizon.

A small network of trails into the backcountry of side canyons but the majority of the canyon remains as untracked and wild as ever.

I advise the wet suit, but if you are renting a dry suit, do not rent one with booties built in.  Every drop of water that leaks in (and it does, canyoneering is hard on dry suits) flows to your feet.   So these booties end up holding tons of cold water against your feet the entire trip.  Instead, use thick neoprene socks independently of any dry wear on your feet.   \n\nWe took a 150\u2019 9.2mm static rope, a pull cord of the same length and my 30m dynamic 8mm Beal alpine-glacier rope which is bomber in canyons.

From there, drive to The Chattooga River Trail that runs south from a parking lot in the Nantahala National Forest near the Whiteside Cemetery, descending to the river below Green Creek down to connect with the Bull Pen Bridge Trail (AKA \"The Iron Bridge\").\r\n\r\nBull Pen Road", "Camping": "Walk-in camping allowed, with wilderness rules applying in the Ellicott Rock Wilderness.\r\n\r\nCliffs", "Overview": "\n             \r\n\r\nThe Chattooga River cuts a gorge that begins near its headwaters in North Carolina, then flows along the border between South Carolina and Georgia, forming one of the best whitewater streams in the eastern USA, perhaps in all of the country.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Flat waterFirst made famous (or infamous) by the film adaptation of the novel DELIVERANCE by James Dickey, the Chattooga filled in for the fictional Cahulawassee River, which was, in fact, a fantasized version of the Coosawattee River that flows through Ellijay Georgia and which now has been inundated by Carters Reservoir. That river was impounded by Carters Dam, one of the largest earthen dams on the planet, and which succeeded in destroying a vast wilderness that lay on either side of the deep gorge cut by the river as it exited the mountains to spill out onto the Piedmont. In places that gorge was 700 feet deep and not a single human inhabited the forests from the edges of Ellijay to the site of the dam. The loss of that wilderness is one of the great untold tragedies of the eastern US.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, for years, everyone assumed James Dickey was writing about the Chattooga when, in fact, he was writing about the Coosawattee and the people of Gilmer County. As a resident for a time in Gilmer County during the early 1970s, I can assure you that James Dickey was not writing in metaphor when he delineated the inhabitants of that area so exactingly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, if one wants to see an existing river that\u2019s a rough approximation\u00a0Sluice of a river that is now under many hundreds of feet of reservoir, you can journey to the area where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet. The river itself is \u00a0Lower Fallsrelatively well protected, but the usual criminals we know as suburban sprawl and over development encroach on all sides and threaten to destroy what remains of the wilderness aspect of the watershed. In addition, the hemlock wooly adelgid has wiped out the two hemlock species in the gorge and every one of these trees you encounter is either already dead or almost so. In a couple of more years the gorge will not have a single living hemlock tree.\r\n\r\nThis section of the gorge, in North Carolina, is less rugged and slightly more protected than the sections that lie to the south. The Ellicott\u2019s Rock Wilderness Area is here, locking up a few thousand acres from \u00a0Swimmin' holeexploitation, but one doesn\u2019t have to hike very far to encounter the back yard of the vacation home of some multi-millionaire. Also, this section is not quite so impressive as farther downstream, with fewer sheer rock walls and not quite so impressive rapids and waterfalls.\r\n\r\nThe best way to experience the gorge in North Carolina is to hike the \u00a0DeadfallChattooga River Trail in the Nantahala National Forest. One trail terminus is at a well graded and well marked parking area on Whitecove Road, and the other end is at The Iron Bridge on Bull Pen Road. There is more space for parking on Whitecove Road than at The Iron Bridge.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be tempting to kayak or tube this section of the Chattooga River, this is not currently allowed. This upper section of the river has been reserved for fly-fishing only, and the activities of kayakers and other water sports enthusiasts would interfere with the fishing. So, to avoid confrontations with fishermen (or getting arrested), don\u2019t kayak this section of the Chattooga.\r\n\r\nAlso, be aware that fans of Off Road Vehicles sometimes flaunt the law and\u00a0Bridge bring their stinking four-wheeling down into the gorge where they have been known to threaten hikers, whom some of them consider not worthy of life. These assholes generally carry firearms, so it\u2019s not wise to confront them. Just report the incidents at the nearest National Forest office as soon as you can (to no effect).\r\n\r\nOne can find some actual real solitude during certain months along the Chattooga River drainage within the Ellicott\u2019s Rock Wilderness. Despite being near the hideous spreading cancers of Highlands and Cashiers, the wilderness offers a chance to avoid crowds of people and witness something akin to a peaceful and quiet journey through a southern mountain ecosystem.\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Mar5,2008/Mar9,2008", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=35.00700&amp;distance_lon_9=-83.10881&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">35.00700\u00b0N/83.10881\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Trail\r\n\r\nHiking trail only.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "\u00a0Near the SpringFrom Albuquerque, drive north on I-25 to Santa Fe.  You have two main options for travel through Santa Fe: either the Santa Fe Relief Route or St. Francis Drive.  The Santa Fe Relief Route takes you around the west side of the city and connects with 84 north.  St. Francis Drive is 84 north, but heads directly through the city.  The Relief Route is probably faster during rush hour, but St. Francis Drive is actually faster at other times.\r\n\r\nOnce on 84, head north to Espa\u00f1ola.  Once in Espa\u00f1ola, you will need to turn left onto Fairview Road (a major intersection).  Head several miles, then turn right onto Paseo de O\u00f1ate (Chama Highway 84 \u2013 BUT it is not labeled as such!).  Follow 84 all the way past Abiquiu, the Abiquiu Lake turn-off, the Ghost Ranch Conference Center, and the Ghost Ranch Museum until you see the labeled turn-off to the left for Forest Road 151.  The sign will also indicate Christ in the Desert Monastery.\r\n\r\nFollow the dirt road 12.7 miles to the entrance of Christ in the Desert Monastery (signed).  At that point turn around and go back .3 miles.  The trail is unmarked and heads to the canyon on your left (East).  There is a parking pull-out just down the road.\r\n\r\nThe last stop for gas is at Bode\u2019s General Store in Abiquiu.  It is worth the stop.  Inside there is a little caf\u00e9, and across the street is the house where Georgia O\u2019Keefe stayed when she spent time in Abiquiu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Camping": "Dispersed camping is allowed in the Santa Fe National Forest.  Please check their website in advance for any fire restrictions.\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Located deep in the heart of Georgia O\u2019Keefe country, Chavez Canyon is carved into the sandstone of Mesa de Las Viejas just west of Abiquiu Lake, a recreation area managed by the US Army Corps of Engineers.  The canyon is situated within the 50,300 acre Chama River Canyon Wilderness, providing solitude and an easy off-trail canyoneering experience in the Santa Fe National Forest.  The highlight of the canyon is two slot sections carved into the multi-hued sandstone.  The second slot is shorter, but the walls rise precipitously and are reminiscent of Utah-style slot canyons.  Hikers to this canyon will enjoy the absence of crowds, scrambling through the canyon bottom, and the views of the towering sandstone cliffs.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Giant Sandstone Walls Mark the Entrance to Chavez Canyon\u00a0Deep in the Heart of Georgia O'Keefe CountryThe Chama River Canyon Wilderness lies just to the north of the Jemez Mountains, and is guarded by the famous Cerro Pedernal.   The Chama River has been deemed a Wild and Scenic River, and is popular with rafters and fishermen.  The walls of the river canyon are composed of multi-colored sandstone including reds, whites, and yellow, all marking the different sedimentary layers.  70-80 bird species have been recorded in the area.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is not a maintained trail into Chavez Canyon, numerous feet have created a trail that is easy to find, and gets hikers quickly into the canyon bottom.  Other maintained trails in the Chama River Canyon Wilderness include The Hart Trail (#293) (a 1.5 mile, 400 foot elevation drop to the Rio Chama) and the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail.  There are also numerous access points to the Rio Chama along Forest Road 151.  The first is named Big Eddy, has toilet facilities, and is open May through September.\r\n\r\nSituated literally hundreds of yards from Chavez Canyon is the famous Christ in the Desert Monastery.  These monks are in the Subiaco Congregation of the Order of Saint Benedict, with an emphasis on humility, silence, and obedience.  The chapel is a well-known landmark created by George Nakashima, a Japanese-American woodworker and architect.  The Monastery does offer rooms for rent between $60-$145 a night with a minimum of a 2-night stay, however the lodging is designed to offer guests a chance to share in the Benedictine way of life.\r\n\r\nAlso located nearby (at the junction of 84 and Forest Road 151) is the Ghost Ranch Education and Retreat Center.  Ghost Ranch is probably most famous for being one of the haunts of Georgia O\u2019Keefe where she painted many of her exquisite works.  Given to the Presbyterian Church in 1955 the 21,000 acre Ghost Ranch is a spiritual education center complete with courses, retreats, lodging, hiking, and a museum.  The museum is famous for its displays on the geology, archaeology, and paleontology of the region, as well as the culture, history and tradition of northern New Mexico.  The museum is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 9am to 5pm.\u00a0The Carved Cross\r\n\r\nThe American Canyoneering Academy rating system would consider this canyon very easy at 1A I meaning that it is typically a non-technical dry canyon that can be accomplished in just a few hours...if you are just hiking to the dryfalls.  If you include climbing the technical dryfalls, then the rating would jump to 3A II requiring climbing gear, technical knowledge, and more time to complete.  The canyon may be hiked at all times of the year, but the July-August monsoon season can bring deadly flash floods through the canyon.  Do not attempt to hike this canyon during wet weather!! Occasionally, there may be pools that require some wading.  Care must be taken at all times, there have been two deaths in and around the area.  One man died from rockfall, and a woman died when she fell to her death from attempting to climb the sandstone walls.  A cross marks the spot where she died.\r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "May24,2011/Feb15,2016", "Maps": "The USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps are Navajo Peak (NM) and Laguna Peak (NM).\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=36.36850&amp;distance_lon_9=-106.67700&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">36.36850\u00b0N/106.677\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Canyon Description": "The first portion of the trail is an unmarked, but well-worn, foot-path through the Junipers and Pinyon Pine.  As the trail slowly gains elevation, the sandstone walls of the canyon become more visible.  After about \u00bc mile, the trail drops down into the wash, crosses some water, and climbs back out again.  The trail then climbs more steeply and after a hundred yards or so, it drops back into the wash and peters out.  Turn to your right and follow the canyon upstream.  The sandstone walls tower overhead, and the wash cuts through the sandstone.  There will probably be a small amount of water here bubbling up from a spring a hundred feet upstream.  Overhead, there is a log wedged sideways between the bank and the sandstone, evidence of the mighty force of flood-waters.  As the wash turns the corner and heads left, the water dries out, and there are small chunks of yellow sandstone lying in the middle of the dried-up stream.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Yellow Sandstone Chunks\u00a0Logjam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther on past the yellow sandstone chunks, a triangle boulder lies in the center of the wash.  At this point, the walls suddenly narrow, and the first slot is encountered.  Once past this boulder, watch for a carved cross in the sandstone wall to your right.  The walls are low, but the water has carved some holes, and smooth formations in the rock.   At the end of this slot portion, there is a short scramble, either up a smooth water-carved slide straight-ahead, or up a chock-stone boulder wedged into a cleft to your right.  Once past this obstacle, keep heading upstream as the canyon curves to the left and then to the right.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Back Down the First Slot\u00a0The Upper Dry-Fall\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickly you will reach the second slot portion.  Here, the sandstone has been worn down by the force of water.  There are two branches.  The left branch enters a slot that is about 50 feet long and ends in a 40 foot pour-off.  The pour-off is un-climbable without gear.  The second branch to the right is about 150 feet long and looks like a Utah-style slot canyon.  The wash twists its way through sandstone walls easily 150 feet high.  There are several dry \u2018pools\u2019 and a 12 foot dry-fall is encountered.  The dry-fall can be easily negotiated using a chimney technique.  However, once above the dry-fall, there is another dry-fall in about 25 feet.  This fall is higher and requires climbing gear to surmount.  Yet, it seems like the slot dies out above the dry-fall, so there is not much impetus to climb it.\r\n\r\nThe total hike distance is about 2 miles round-trip.  It is easily done in 2 hours or less.  There were plenty of birds to see, as well as evidence of Elk and other ungulates.  For the more adventurous, bring some climbing gear and continue on in the canyon above the slots.

This will not take you to the canyon.", "Geology, History, and Ethics": "\u00a0TOPO! Map of AreaGeology  \r\nThe South Platte River begins on the northern flanks of Mount Lincoln and flows across South Park, eventually pooling in the southwestern portion of the park in Elevenmile Reservoir, near Lake George. The water from Elevenmile Reservoir flows northeast and cuts into the Pikes Peak batholith, creating Elevenmile Canyon with millions of years of snowmelt. The soaring walls of the canyon are comprised of Pikes Peak pinkish granite, polished grey from years of erosion. The focal point of the canyon is the South Platte River, and its cold and rushing waters. A dense Ponderosa Pine forest lines the gentler canyon walls, interspersed with imposing granite cliffs. \r\n\r\nThe mouth of Elevenmile Canyon is approximately 8000' above sea level, and the base of the canyon rises to 8500' at the reservoir. The canyon walls rise dramatically from the river, sometimes sweeping up 400-500' above the water. The high altitude of this area precludes most types of climbing in late fall through mid spring due to snowpack and closure.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nFrom what is known, climbing began in Elevenmile Canyon in the 1960s, and the Colorado Mountain Club probably climbed the first routes in the canyon. Early interest in the canyon was stymied by other popular front range climbing locations like Garden of the Gods and Eldorado Canyon. Many unclimbed lines remained dormant for a decade. \r\n\r\nThe late 1970s brought some renewed interest, and difficult climbs in the 5.11 range began to go up throughout the canyon. The 1980s brought full-on interest in Elevenmile. Climbers such as Ricard Aschert, Dale Goddard, Mark Milligan, Mark Rolofson, Neil Cannon, and Bob D'Antonio began to send classic routes up to 5.13. The discovery of Shelf Road near Canyon City again drew climbers from Elevenmile, and activity in the canyon lay dormant until the mid 1990s. \r\n\r\nSince the 1990s, Elevenmile Canyon has had a period of renewed interest, but the number of climbers that frequent this high canyon are dwarfed by the hordes that descend upon Garden of the Gods, Shelf Road, and the crags near Boulder and Denver. Indeed, there are countless routes in Elevenmile waiting for development, scores more if one explores some of the side canyons. \r\n\r\nEthics\r\nBecause Elevenmile Canyon gets less traffic than other crags, the potential for ethics violations here is great, simply because there might be nobody around who will notice what you are doing. Unfortunately, the 1980s brought a rush of indiscriminate bolting, chipping, and gluing, like many other crags around the country. Since then, climbers have become a more ethical group, but problems still occur at Elevenmile. Today, phantom bolters are the big issue, but their handiwork is usually quickly removed. \r\n\r\nThe consensus among climbers here is that Elevenmile should remain mostly traditional, and bolting should only occur on face climbs where no natural protection is possible. Chipping and gluing, like everywhere else in the world, is completely unacceptable. \r\n                                        ", "Camping": "Camping is available throughout the canyon. Elevenmile Canyon is contained within the Pike National Forest, so the several named campsites are regulated by the PNF.

", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\u00a0\r\nElevenmile Canyon is a relatively unknown gem of the Pikes Peak region. Located south of the small town of Lake George, this wide canyon was cut by the South Platte River, leaving clean gray granite cliffs suitable for rock climbing. Unlike the unstable rock climbing elsewhere in the Pikes Peak region, such as Garden of the Gods, Elevenmile Canyon is comprised of solid, polished granite. Rock climbing routes here run the gamut - major crack systems, delicate face climbs, trad, sport, single pitch, multi-pitch, and bouldering. The best feature of the canyon is that you won't find the crowds normally present at crags nearer to Denver, Boulder, and Colorado Springs. Indeed, there are typically far more fly fishermen in Elevenmile than rock climbers. \r\n\r\nI won't include any information about fishing or water sports on this page, but fishermen should note that this canyon is supposed to be one of the best fly fishing locations in Colorado. Elevenmile Reservoir has a lot of boating and fishing as well. I've seen kayakers in the canyon, but I have no idea where they actually kayak. Hunters can also be seen in this area, especially during duck season. \r\n\r\nI intend this page to be an overview of the canyon, and I'll add a few rock climbing routes as time allows.

I would pencil it in, and then pass it by to hit some other place that I figured had more to see and do. Don\u2019t do as I did and put it off for decades. Go and see it as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not because it\u2019s endangered in any great way and might not be here tomorrow. That\u2019s not it, at all. The finest two and a half miles of it are completely in the hands of Pisgah National Forest, so there\u2019ll be no housing or commercial development taking place there. That area is good and safe, unless you consider that the locals could love it to death, which is a distinct possibility.\r\n\r\nBut I can\u2019t blame them for flocking by thousands every weekend to enjoy the place. Imagine one of the most beautiful whitewater streams in the eastern USA, and then understand that it\u2019s accessible by an excellent gravel road along its finest section, and that most of the nearby folk are poor and can\u2019t afford to travel very far to spend leisure time. This is a recipe for huge crowds, which in the past were often loud, unruly, and quite frankly dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut the National Forest Service installed some nice parking areas (which\u00a0Closing In. fill up quickly on weekends) and staircases down into the gorge, and a couple of bathrooms. This alleviated some of the most extreme problems, but by all means not all of them. The addition of a visitor\u2019s center by Caldwell County helped a lot, too. Plus, the National Forest Service added flush toilets to the Mortimer Campground and this took off some of the nastiest sort of pressure from the best stretch of whitewater.\r\n\r\nThen the local Sheriff\u2019s Department decided to keep two squad cars patrolling up and down the access road all day Saturday and Sunday, and this succeeded in stopping the very worst of the rowdy behavior that was making thing unpleasant for other folk trying to enjoy the Gorge. If you visit on a weekend, you can count on these deputies to be nearby from morning until sundown.\r\n\r\nWhile there are no endangered animals in the Gorge, this does not mean that there is a shortage of wild plants and animals. These things are present in plenty. In an increasingly unique situation, though, all of the plants and animals are in ecologically decent shape. The forests are vigorous second growth of pines and cove hardwoods, and these are home to a tremendous variety of birds, including wild turkey, redwing hawks, screech owls, and many others. Bobcats, black bears, beavers, otters, mink, cottontail rabbits, white tail deer, and groundhogs are commonly seen in these forests.\r\n\r\nThe entire river, even the privately owned sections, is part of the National Wild & Scenic Rivers system. From the spot on Calloway Peak where Wilson Creek begins, to the point where it enters the Johns River, it lies completely surrounded by the Pisgah National Forest, but with only a bit less than ten miles of its 23+mile length being in public hands.\r\n\r\nWhen you are hiking the trails or spending time in the Mortimer area, it\u2019s hard to believe that this spot was once home to a thriving community of hundreds of people and the location of both a textile mill and a large lumber mill. Both of these mills were washed away by floods in 1940 and never replaced. These days, unless you know precisely where to look, you\u2019d never know that they were even there. It all looks like recovering wilderness, showing one the soothing hand of Mother Nature if only She\u2019s given the opportunity to work Her magic.\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Creek Gorge is a place that I can recommend as highly and as confidently as any I\u2019ve written about here on Summitpost. I will say that, unless you\u2019re kayaking, it\u2019s probably best to avoid the gorge on warm summer weekends. Unless, of course, you don\u2019t mind the enormous crowds, clouds of chalky granite dust churned up on the road, heavy traffic as thick as in any urban area, and lots of very annoying noise. Some people can block that out. And kayakers are likely to hear only the roar of Wilson Creek at high water, and to even lose sight of the crowds in some of the bits of the river where the locals can\u2019t park their cars to get out and look.\r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jun6,2009/Jun7,2009", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=35.88170&amp;distance_lon_9=-81.70920&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">35.88170\u00b0N/81.7092\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Much of the river is in private hands.

{"Willis Creek": "\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTrail Description - Willis Creek is a narrow and photogenic canyon with walls towering up to 300'. When the sun shines into the canyon it has a gorgeous yellow glow that can be captured by the camera at certain times of the day. This is a wonderful hike for families since there are no obstacles but holds the option for more difficulty by combining it with Sheep Creek and Bull Valley Gorge. To do this route it's better to start at Bull Valley Gorge, which is a semi-technical canyon, and end at Willis Creek. Like most canyons, this one is shaded making it ideal for summer hiking and to keep things ever cooler there is a narrow and crystal clear, year-round stream, meandering through its center. The one drawback, at least for hikers, is that horses often are ridden through the canyon leaving behind what horses tend to leave behind.\r\n\r\nAverett Canyon and Sheep Creek - At about a mile into the route Averett Canyon enters from the left and another mile and half later is the confluence with Sheep Creek where the narrows section has already come to an end and soon the water will usually quit running. Sheep Creek is hot in the summer with little refuge from the sun. You may notice while you are in there that ATV's often drive up and down Sheep Creek. I have never seen or heard them but I have noticed tracks and picked up trash left by ATV or horseback riders that is too heavy for hikers to carry in. Please if you visit these canyons, leave no trace other than foot prints! \r\n\r\nTrailhead - To get to the trailhead you can drive a regular car on the Skutumpah Road, (on the GSENM as Road 500) which is a dirt backway into the Monument. Travel is easy as long as the roads are dry, although it can get muddy directly around Willis Creek due to the running stream. This area can be avoided by just parking and hiking a little bit farther. If Skutumpah Road is wet then it is usually impassable even for 4WD's due to the clay content. Don't try to travel it if there is still snow on the road. Melting snow seems to be the biggest problem on these roads for vehicles getting stuck. There can also be flood damage at times. The trailhead is just off Skutumpah Road, 9 miles from Cannonville, where one of the Grand Staircase Visitor Centers is located.  If coming from Kanab, where another Visitor Center is located, or on the Backway through Glendale, it will be 1.8 miles after you drive over the narrow bridge that covers Bull Valley Gorge. This bridge is impossible to miss. You should be quite tentative about driving over it. It looks old, narrow and quite rickety! You can also set your odometer where Skutumpah and Johnson Canyon intersect. The trailhead is 27 miles past this point. The canyon will not be visible from the road but you will see a wash with running water on both sides of the road since the stream crosses under the road.  From the Cannonville entrance you will want to follow the wash to your left and from the other direction from your right.\r\n\r\nKiosk and Parking - The kiosk for the trailhead is off the main road, just south of the creek, and there is parking across the road from the trailhead.\r\n\r\nFlash Floods - Check weather conditions before you go.

To make it more confusing, along this road is also the Arizona and Utah state line. Utah's Kane County and Garfield County enclose the monument lands. Kane County claims 68 percent of the monument and Garfield County holds 32 percent. The geography of the Staircase exceeds the monument boundaries including some of the most popular parks in the National Park System; the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon. The geology ascends from the bottom of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon through Zion National Park and topping out at Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks.

Don't camp in low areas that are prone to flash flooding.\r\n\u00a0", "Overview": "\n            Panthertown Valley\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanthertown Valley is a rare formation in the Southeast. Briefly, it\u2019s a huge, U-shaped high elevation valley. This type of valley is extremely rare in the Eastern highlands, and especially rare when the area remains largely undeveloped.\r\n\r\nMuch of Panthertown Valley lies at, or just above 3,400 feet above sea level. It is surrounded by peaks that range from 4,000 to 4,800 feet. The valley floor is home to a number of rare high bogs and many streams cut through the valley before pouring out of the Panthertown area to tumble down the Blue Ridge escarpment to the east.\r\n\r\nLittle Green dome.\r\n\r\nThe entire area from Highlands NC to Panthertown is often referred to as the \u201cYosemite of the East\u201d. Not in least part because of the number of granite plutons that dot the region, and for the amazing number of spectacular waterfalls in this relatively compact vicinity. The two highest cliffs in the eastern USA are in this area, and the climbing opportunities are many and varied.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nAt several overlooks in and around Panthertown Valley, one becomes acutely aware of the climbing walls in the valley. At both Salt Rock overlook and on the cliffs of Little Green Mountain, there are large walls of granite to be seen in almost every direction. The valley remains a climbers delight, and yet is lightly visited. There are also great opportunities for whitewater rafting in the streams within this great valley.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Cliffs of Little Green Mountain.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-80s, when the undeveloped 7,000 acres of Panthertown were made available for sale, both the Nature Conservancy and the state of North Carolina expressed interest in nabbing this huge chunk of real estate so that it could be preserved as wilderness. However, the Duke Power Company, with its bottomless pockets, stepped in and grabbed the land before it could be preserved. They took a power line right of way that almost bisects the valley, into which they assembled a series of towers, and so what would otherwise be unbroken wilderness is cut by an enormous slash through the center of Panthertown. After Duke Power had taken their right of way and made this most painful cut, they \u201cgenerously\u201d sold off the remainder of the valley to the Nature Conservancy who then transferred ownership to the National Forest Service, thus grabbing a hefty period of good neighbor propaganda for the rapacious corporate titan.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nToday, Panthertown Valley is a slowly recovering ecosystem. Long abused by timbering interests and the accompanying problems of wildfire and erosion, the forests there are just beginning to get back to something like normal. Of course the hemlocks trees there are doomed from the hemlock wooly adelgid infestation, but many of the other trees are doing well. The water table is relatively pristine and is home to native brook trout that ply the cold, clean waters to be found there. Panthertown is also good bear habitat, and coyotes have moved into the valley. High dollar real estate development encroaches on every side of Panthertown, and vistas that once revealed only unbroken forests now are marred by big homes sitting high on ridges owned by the wealthy elite.\r\n\r\nStill and all, one can definitely find real solitude within the almost 7,000 acres of Panthertown. You won\u2019t see or hear any panthers, but you will enjoy mountain vistas and amazing waterfalls and hear the sound of clear, free-running streams and cataracts. For something akin to a wilderness experience, Panthertown Valley is worth visiting.\r\n\r\nSchoolhouse Falls", "Created/Edited": "Jan22,2007/Apr12,2007", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=35.16300&amp;distance_lon_9=-83.01400&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">35.16300\u00b0N/83.014\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "None.\r\n\r\nPrime bear habitat.

A superb Klamm that has enjoyed the status of a National Monument for close on 100 years, and rightly so as it is not just the Partnach racing though that is the attraction, but also the waterfalls crashing down the vertical sides of the narrow Klamm. \r\n\r\nThere is a high level bridge over the Klamm connecting the Hausberg and Eckbauer hiking areas, but to fully appreciate the magnificence of this spectacle it is far better to walk though, using the narrow path that wends it\u2019s way in and out of short tunnels in the rock next to the rushing waters.\u00a0Curtain of ice\r\n \r\nThe path can be quite busy due to it\u2019s close proximity to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, ( half an hours walk).

In keeping with Texas State Park philosophy, the campground is packed and offers lots of amenities, which either satisfies people\u2019s needs or to some, detracts from the natural, ourdoor experience. The other option is the primitive camping area that exists in the canyon, along the river. This area has pit toilets and is accessed via the Wolf Mountain Trail. \r\n\r\nPedernales State Park Primitive Camping Area\r\n", "Map": "Pedernales State Park\r\n\r\nPedernales River", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Pedernales Falls in the Pedernales River Canyon\r\nWhen one thinks of canyons in Texas, the first things that generally come to mind are the magnificent canyons along the Rio Grande and the canyons of the Caprock. Outside of these areas, the state hardly has enough relief to justify calling anything a \u201ccanyon\u201d. And yet, along the edges of the Edwards Plateau, in the Texas Hill Country (the epicenter of all things Texan) there are several canyons incised into the limestone that makes up the region. Some of the more interesting canyons are found west of Austin, such as the narrow canyons carved by Barton Creek. However, while there may be slightly deeper canyons in the Hill Country, none offer the spectacle as the Pedernales (pronounced \u201cpuhr-den-alice\u201d) River Canyon. Not only does the canyon have rugged walls, but it is also home to Pedernales Falls, some of the most torturous white water in the state of Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Pedernales River is among the shortest of the significant rivers that pass through the Hill Country. It begins in southeastern Kimble County and flows east, through Gilliespie County, passing south of Fredericksburg. Upon entering Blanco County, its flow begins to trend northward, passing north of Johnson City. Beyond this point the river passes through Hays County before entering Travis County and emptying into Lake Travis, and reservoir formed by impounding the Colorado River of Texas. Most of its flow up to its passage north of Johnson City is through fairly level ground with only a small, albeit steep-sided channel. After passing Johnson City, the river enters Pedernales Falls State Park and the character of the river changes dramatically once it enters the Pedernales River Canyon and passes over Pedernales Falls. Rather than meandering through the Hill Country as it has prior to its entrance into the park, it becomes a swiftly moving river, passing over an impressive series of cataracts. The canyon itself is not particularly deep for much of its length but the walls are steep and rugged. Beyond the falls, the canyon deepens a bit and has some exposed limestone bluffs that make it attractive. Nonetheless, it is the falls that inevitably and understandably draw attention.\r\n\u00a0Limestone along the Pedernales River\r\nAs noted, the Pedernales River has a fairly slow and meandering course for much of its journey. This changes dramatically upon entering the Pedernales River Canyon. The distinguishing characteristic is Pedernales Falls. Though not a tall vertical waterfall, it is instead a nearly 2 mile long series of cataracts that pour over a succession of limestone dikes that make up the riverbed. The river at this point is reminiscent of Cossatot Falls in Arkansas. The most dramatic section of the falls is the final 0.2 miles, in which the drops on the cataracts become a bit higher and the river finally pours over a series of slick cascades in which the water fans out a bit beyond the basic river channel. In addition to these cataracts, the river flows through a convoluted series of channels and troughs, creating a maze of rocks and torrent filled trenches. Although the entire section of the river from Johnson City to Lake Travis is popular with kayakers, the part that flows through the park, with all of its limestone dikes, offers a particularly exciting stretch of whitewater when water levels are high. \r\n\r\nThe a significant portion of the Pedernales River Canyon is encompassed by Pedernales Falls State Park. The river is the obvious highlight of the park, but trails leading to classic Hill Country terrain and old an old homestead offer diversions from the riparian attractions. Due to the park\u2019s proximity to the Austin metropolitan area, it is often heavily impacted on the weekends. For an opportunity to observe the falls without crowds mobbing the waters, it is necessary to arrive at the park promptly when it opens. In spite of the effort required to see the falls without the sunbathers, swimmers and gawkers, experiencing the Pedernales River Canyon and Pedernales Falls is one of the highlights of the Texas Hill Country. \r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Apr10,2012/Apr11,2012", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=30.33729&amp;distance_lon_9=-98.25206&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">30.33729\u00b0N/98.25206\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Routes": "\u00a0Pedernales Falls\r\nThe Pedernales River Canyon is accessible via a number of trails.

It is feasible to range pretty far upstream from the viewpoint. The further one gets, the fewer the people one is likely to encounter. About 100 yards upstream from the large, fan like cascade visible from the viewpoint there is a 10 foot cataract on the river that forms the highest single free fall among the series of cascades.

The Escalante Canyon has a long history of human occupation. The Ute Indians for years had made the North Fork of the Escalante River their winter home. Early settlers, attracted by the year-long water supply and sheltering cliffs, son pushed the Indians off the land. \r\nMany cattle outfits began using the canyon as their winter quarters. In 1886, John Musser took up residence in one of the first homesteads in the canyon where he operated the Musser Cattle Company. Over the years the company has acquired ranch after ranch so that now most of the grazing paddocks along the canyon's entire length are consolidated under Musser Cattle. \r\nThe infamous Colorado Sheep War centered around cattlemen protecting their grazing land from flocks of hungry sheep. In the early 1900s, an unwritten code existed which relegated sheep to one side of the Gunnison River. When a swinging bridge was built over the river and sheep travelled across, the cattlemen retaliated by shooting hundreds of sheep. Two residents of the canyon died in the shootout. \r\n\r\nWalker CabinMe inside Walker's CabinCaptain Smith CabinScenic road\r\n\r\nMost people lived very peaceably with one another. Henry Walker, and his large family built brick cabin, which still stands there. Built in 1911, the family was unable to afford cement for the mortar between the bricks, so Henry and his four sons laid the bricks using mud dug from a hole in the yard. The cement that exists on the cabin today is a thin coating, applied later after the family earned enough money to buy the materials. The Colorado Division of Wildlife owns the historic building today and visitors are welcome to explore the cabin. \r\nAnother resident, Captain Henry A. Smith, was particularly sociable. When Smith was 65, the small but spunky man packed up and left his lifelong home of Joliet, Indiana to serve in the Civil War. Though he only served a month in the war as acting captain, he became \"Captain\" for life. To accommodate all his visitors, Cap build two houses - one for his guests. The house is now state owned, but remains open to visitors.

Their purpose was to find a practical route between Santa Fe and the new missions in California, to convert Utes and Havasupais and to establish a chain of mission stations between Santa Fe and Monterey. Neither objective was realized, but they explored more unknown territory than Lewis and Clark. The Escalante expedition did not actually traverse this section of the Gunnison river, having circled to the east of Grand Mesa. In 1875, however geologists with the Hayden survey named the creek Rio Escalante and down the stream Rio Dominguez in honor of these pioneering Spanish Padres. \r\nThe two Franciscan Friars, the most famous Spanish explorers of western North America, were the first non-Indians to visit the Colorado Plateau. Where they passed they left a rich heritage of Spanish place names. The explorers passed close to Cortez, Colorado, circled east of Grand Mesa, then crossed the Colorado River at Moab and the Green River at Green River, Utah. They continued north to the area of Vernal, Utah, and northwest to Provo and the Salt Lake territory, where they turned southwest to the area of St. George. \r\nDominguez and Escalante noted in detail the land they traversed. \r\n", "Escalante Creek": "Escalante Creek flows into Gunison River, and later on into Colorado River.

{"When To Climb": "The trailhead is not accessible between early December through late February in most years. Summer is extremely hot with temperatures exceeding 100F degrees (38C). Winter temperatures drop well below 0F (-18C).  The best times of the year for this adventure are mid-March through May and then again in mid-September through mid-November.  Muddy Creek can be very cold before April. There is some flash flood potential in the narrow sections, so have a good weather forecast before heading down the canyon.   Muddy Creek is usually a very small stream, but in some years it can be waist or more deep in the spring (April and May).  This is rare however. \r\n\r\nThis is a land of weather extremes.  Temperatures in the nearest towns have ranged from -42F to 112F at Green River and -35F to 114F at Hanksville.  On the day we went through the morning low was 15F and the afternoon high was 77F in the shade.  Sunny weather predominates and it only rains a few times a year, but when it does rain, it can really pour!  Don't underestimate flash flood danger.\r\n\r\nThis is a harsh desert with extremes in temperature.", "Getting There": "A journey to out in the middle of no-where............ \r\n\r\nAs mentioned, just finding the trailhead is a navigational challenge. You must do the vehicle shuttle the day before the trip, as it will be a long day just getting through the canyon. You absolutely must have the 7.5 minute quads (maps) Big Bend Draw and Ireland Mesa for the drive to the trailhead. Even then, the maps are inaccurate especially near the trailhead. A 4wd is also required. \r\n\r\nTo get to the trailhead at the head of the canyon, drive west from Green River, or east of the Emery area along I-70 to exit 108. You must carefully follow the topo maps for the remainder of the drive. Take the southbound gravel road and veer right after a short distance. Stay on the main road until you reach Kimball Draw at an intersection with a sign. This is at about co-ordinates N38*47'16.47\" W111*5'52.69\". Turn left onto the dirt road signposted for Copper Globe. After following the bottom of the wash for a while, you will reach an intersection (no sign and it can be hard to spot[update:  in 2007, there was a sign for \"Designated Vehicle Route\" here]) at about co-ordinates N38*47'4.42\" W111*4'34.19\". Turn right onto a seldom used track. Follow the track in and out of several drainages until you reach an intersection at a top of a hill at about co-ordinates N38*46'24.02\" W111*3'57.04\". Turn right here. The road weaves in and out of drainages and scenic and colorful badlands and is one of the most interesting pieces of road construction I've ever seen. There are some sections of the road that pass through sparkling gypsum beds. Not too far after the road climbs out of Dizzy Trail Canyon (see the topo map), you will reach a junction next to a small hill with a cairn (pile of rocks) on top. \r\n\r\nFrom here on, the topo map is inaccurate as far as showing the many tracks go, so pay attention closely to the topographic features on the map. There are many routes to the trailhead, but here's the route we took. Turn right at the junction with the hill and cairn. You will cross a few very rough spots in the road while crossing two washes. After the second wash, make a very sharp left turn onto a track that heads east [update:   this track was just about invisible when we were here in 2007, so see the alternate route below]. \r\n\r\nNote #1: In 2004, I found an alternate route to the trailhead. The road is not as rough from this alternate route, but the trailhead can be harder to recognize from this direction, as this route has no landmarks near the trailhead. At the hill with the cairn, continue straight instead of right. Look for a faint track to the right not far beyond the hill with the cairn. This road leads to the trailhead, but it\u2019s hard to recognize. Hopefully the cairn I left will still be there!\r\n\r\nThe trailhead and where you're aiming for is very near the 6350 elevation marked on the Ireland Mesa quad NW of the word \"DIKE\" on the map.  We parked here.  There are actually several possible trailheads, including following the track marked on the topo map down to Poncho Wash.  We chose to start here because we did Gem Canyon (see the mountain page on that canyon) on the same trip.    Otherwise continue past the rough washes as mentioned above and park at the stock tank in Poncho Wash.\r\n\r\nMake sure to leave Green River or Castle Dale with a full tank of gas!

Alternately, you can also re-ascend the canyon once reaching Muddy Creek.\r\n\r\nYou must be proficient in routefinding and navigation with a topo map to follow this route.  There are several possible routes to the head of the canyon, and all routes require careful navigation with the topo map.  There are several drainages that converge before the canyon deepens.  Any of them are possible routes and all require some scrambling.  Here's the route we took.  See the Route Page for much more detail and important coordinates and map references.  From the trailhead at elevation 6350 on the topo map, use a compass to head south while crossing several drainages to the little drainages to the head of the canyon.  The canyon is shallow for quite a while, but eventually it deepens.  There will be several obstacles to surmount.   The canyon gets better and better as you continue.  Another drop will be encountered that requires a rappel.  This is followed by a slot section of  the canyon.  Continue down canyon.  There are several 5th class downclimbs and the longest rappel and it is almost 60 feet.  Follow the spectacular slot to Muddy Creek.  There are now three options. \r\n\r\nOption #1  \r\n\r\nThe first option is to ascend back up the canyon the way you came.  Of course to do this, you may have to leave ropes behind at every drop, and you may have to have mechanical ascenders.

{"Activities": "Canyoneering", "Getting There": "There is no easy way to get to the Enchanted Gorge. The shortest and most-direct approach is from the town of Bishop in the Owens Valley. This approach will take two days and involves class-3 scrambling over the 13,000-foot Sierra Crest with your pack.\r\n\r\nThe approaches from the west (Fresno and the San Joaquin Valley) involve 20 to 25 miles of trail hiking and a few miles of cross-country to get into the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nAlternative approaches involve crossing the Sierra Divide at lower-elevation passes (such as Bishop Pass) and then hiking two days up or down the John Muir Trail. Since there are so many options, I will discuss only the most direct approaches from the east (Bishop and the Owens Valley).\r\n\r\nDIRECT EASTERN APPROACHES FROM THE OWENS VALLEY\r\n\r\nArguments abound regarding the best way to approach to the Ionian Basin from the Owens Valley. Proponents and antagonists argue over the relative difficulties of Haeckel Col, Wallace Col, Echo Col and even Lamarck Col. However, there does appear to be a consensus regarding Wallace Col: avoid it!  Personally, I have never crossed Haeckel Col. But I have crossed Wallace Col, Echo Col and Lamarck Col several times, so I can speak for those passes from personal experience.\r\n\r\nHaeckel Col, Wallace Col and Echo Col are all located in the same general area. From the Owens Valley, drive up to the trail head at Lake Sabrina above Bishop. Take the trail up the Middle Fork of Bishop Creek to Hungry Packer Lake. From there, you can cross the Sierra Divide via one of the three passes. All are arduous crossings, but Haeckel Col is reputedly the easiest of the three and you end up in the heart of the beautiful Evolution region.\r\n\r\nHaeckel Col (class 3, 12,680+ feet)\r\n\r\nHaeckel Col is reputed to be the easiest eastern route to the Ionian Basin. It is the pass north of Mount Haeckel. After climbing over the pass, you will be in the heart of the Evolution near Mount Huxley.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing Haeckel Col, hike out to the John Muir Trail and head south to the vicinity of Wanda Lake. From there, Wanda Pass (12,400+ feet) is a popular route into the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nEcho Col (Class 3, Elevation 12,400+ feet)\r\n\r\nEcho Col is a moderately-difficult notch in the Sierra Crest that will get you to the John Muir Trail in the vicinity of Helen Lake, northwest of Muir Pass. Going through the col is serious class 3. We find it easiest to hand packs up and down when crossing through the notch, rather than trying to climb while wearing packs.\r\n\r\nWhen approaching Echo Col from the Owens Valley side of the crest, look for the black rock on the right side of the cirque. Ascend the right side of the black rock to the notch (class 3) and descend the other side (class 3). Once over the col, you will have to traverse across benches to the vicinity of Muir Pass, and then cross over into the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nEcho Col, E Side Echo Col, E Side Echo Col, W Side Echo Col, W Side \r\n\r\nWallace Col (Class 2, Elevation 13,000+ feet)\r\n\r\nWallace Col is a very high pass that, like Haeckel Col, will drop you into the heart of the Evolution near Mount Huxley. The traverse from Owens Valley side of the Sierra Crest to the west side is a very tiresome slog up snow and loose scree. The reverse crossing is best left for the criminally insane. The west side of the pass is a vast unstable scree slope that would be utterly impossible to climb, especially with a pack. If Zeus needed an alternate location to torture Sisyphus, this would be the spot.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing Wallace Col, hike out to the John Muir Trail and head south to the vicinity of Wanda Lake. Wanda Pass (12,400+ feet) is a convenient way to get from Wanda Lake to the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nWallace Col, E Side Wallace Col, W Side \r\n\r\nLamarck Col (Class 2, Elevation 12,960+ feet)\r\n\r\nSome people argue that the ease of hiking over Lamarck Col outweighs the additional distance one would need to hike from Darwin Canyon. This opinion certainly has its merits, especially when you measure the total distance from the trail head to the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nFrom the North Lake trail head, hike up past Lower Lamarck Lake and climb up onto a bench. From there it is a long, long slog up to Lamarck Col. Perhaps because of the high altitude, it certainly feels longer and more difficult than it should be.\r\n\r\n\r\nLamarck Col, E Side Lamarck Col Lamarck Col Skiing toLamarck Col Lamarck Col \r\n", "Return Up Goddard Canyon": "\u00a0\r\nGoddard Canyon\u00a0\r\nGoddard Canyon\r\n\u00a0\r\nUpper Goddard Canyon\r\nIf you thought the descent of the Enchanted Gorge was beautiful, just wait until you start the return trip up Goddard Canyon. The higher you get up Goddard Canyon, the more magical your journey becomes.\r\n\r\nFor the return trip up Goddard Canyon, it is definitely best to stay on the east side of the creek, at least initially. You will traverse some very steep hill sides, but the views of the waterfalls on the west side of the canyon are spectacular. There are some reports of henous bush whacking on the west side of Goddard Creek. Not that the bush whacking on the east side of the creek is any fun! Besides, there is a creek on the west side that would be very difficult to cross at high water.\r\n\r\nBefore the steep ascent into upper Goddard Canyon you will reach several large waterfalls. Bush whacking to get past these waterfalls is murderous. If you have never had the pleasure of bush whacking through manzanita, get ready for some real fun. Just dive in and take it like a man.\r\n\r\nFinally you will climb into the upper reaches of Goddard Canyon. This is a little-traveled alpine paradise.

However, if you are going through all that trouble to get over to the Enchanted Gorge, why not slow down and savor the experience? A two or three day loop from the Ionian Basin is much more memorable.\r\n\r\nI definitely recommend doing down the Enchanted Gorge and up Goddard Canyon, instead of vice versa. However, you can travel which ever route that you chose. You can even follow in the foot steps of Solomons and Bonner, continuing down Goddard Creek to the Middle Fork of the Kings River.\r\n\r\nAn early-season visit to the Enchanted Gorge allows you take advantage of the snow pack. You can travel quite fast and avoid a lot of unstable talus. However, you will have to deal with high water and dangerous snow bridges over Disappearing Creek.\r\n\r\nLater in the season, when the snow it gone, you will spend a lot of time hiking on unstable scree and talus (ugh!).

Perhaps due to its mystical name, the Enchanted Gorge has an allure that draws many backcountry travelers. Despite its disarming name, the Enchanted Gorge is not an easy trek. In his book The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes, and Trails, R. J. Secor states that the only thing \"enchanted\" about the Enchanted Gorge is its name.\r\n\r\nMost who venture into the Enchanted Gorge would disagree, however. The Enchanted Gorge is perhaps the most remote canyon in the Sierra Nevada, giving the explorer a wonderful sense of isolation. The return trip up through Goddard Canyon is spectacularly beautiful and serene, especially the upper reaches of the canyon. (Actually, Goddard Canyon is much more spectacular than the Enchanted Gorge.)\r\n\r\nThe Enchanted Gorge begins at 12,000 feet in the Ionian Basin at Chasm Lake. Disappearing Creek drops 4,000 feet from its origins at Chasm Lake to its confluence with Goddard Creek six miles down the canyon. The creek was so named because it frequently disappears under giant talus and snow pack. At the entrance to the Enchanted Gorge are two dark metavolcanic peaks named after mythological creatures from Homer's Odyssey: Scylla and Charybdis.\r\n\r\nThe Enchanted Gorge was named by Theodore Solomons after he and his partner E.C. Bonner traversed the gorge in 1851. They were attempting to establish a high route between Yosemite Valley and Kings Canyon, and it was the first recorded exploration of the gorge. Since then many other Sierra travelers have happily followed in their footsteps.\r\n", "Hazards": "\u00a0\r\nSnow Bridge\u00a0\r\nDangerous Snow Bridge\r\nThe most serious hazards in the Enchanted Gorge are the snow bridges over the creek. Be extremely careful where you walk. A fall through a snow bridge can result in a fall into the creek below. Early in the season the torrents will wash you into ice tunnels under the snow pack. BEWARE!\r\n\r\nSome of the bridges are 30 to 50 feet above the creek. We came across a 3-foot diameter hole in the snow pack. When we peered down into the hole we were terrified to see that we were looking 50 feet straight down into the creek from the roof of a huge undercut dome!\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jul12,2008/Aug16,2016", "Adminstrative Remarks": "If you would like to adopt this page, or have suggestions for change, please feel free to contact me.", "Location": "California,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica", "No Impact Camping": "\"Take nothing but pictures, leave nothing (not even footprints)\"\r\n\r\nThe Enchanted Gorge and Goddard Canyon are fairly pristine by Sierra Nevada standards.

The two basic type of igneous rocks found in this area are (1) granite and (2) metavolcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nGranite, of course, is nothing more than crystallized magma. Deep plutons of magma cooled slowly over millions of years, allowing the minerals such as quartz and feldspar to crystallize into the Sierra granite that we know and love.\r\n\r\nThe metavolcanic rocks are volcanic sea beds that have been heavily metamorphosed. These ancient sea beds remind us that that the Sierra Nevada was once underwater off the west coast of North America.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY OF THE IONIAN BASIN\r\n\r\nThe Ionian Basin is almost entirely granitic. Most of the Ionian Basin is composed of a type of granite called alaskite. This granite is mostly feldspar and quartz, and owes its light color to a lack of dark minerals. This is the same granite that is found in the Evolution Basin and LeConte Canyon. The far western rim of the Ionian Basin is composed of a darker, sheared, finer-grained granite associated with Mount Goddard. The granite of the Goddard pendant contains many dikes.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY OF THE ENCHANTED GORGE\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to the Enchanted Gorge are three dark, jagged peaks that differ greatly in appearance from the granite peaks of the Ionian Basin: Scylla, Charybdis and the Three Sirens. These jagged peaks are composed of ancient volcanic sea beds that have been tilted almost vertically. The Enchanted Gorge and the high ridges on both sides are composed almost entirely of similar metavolcanic rock.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are mostly metamorphosed rhyolite (metarhyolite) and metamorphosed dacite tuff (metadacite). Rhyolite is a lightly-colored volcanic rock that contains a high proportion of glass (silica). Dacite is a darker volcanic rock that has a high iron content.\r\n\r\nAs you pass through the outlet of Chasm Lake you will notice a thin ribbon of metavolcanic rock on either side of the lake. However, once you pass the outlet of the lake and enter the Enchanted Gorge, you will travel on bedrock consisting of the granite of the Goddard pendant. (Much of this granite is obscured by the talus of metavolcanic rock that fell from cliffs above.) Further down the gorge you will down-climb numerous benches where the granite bedrock is readily apparent.\r\n\r\nA large round lake marks the half-way point during your descent of the Enchanted Gorge. This lake also marks the transition point where the bedrock changes from granite to metavolcanic rock. In fact, the entire second-half of the Enchanted Gorge is composed entirely of metarhyolite, metadacite tuff and the associated talus. Here, the gorge becomes very narrow and you will get a close look at the metavolcanic rock. Just before you descend into the Goddard Creek drainage, the bedrock abruptly changes to a metarhyolite tuff.\r\n\r\nThere is one last interesting geologic note about the Enchanted Gorge. Although the gorge is V-shaped, it did contain a glacier during the last glaciation. Apparently metavolcanic rocks is rather soft.\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY OF GODDARD CREEK\r\n\r\nAt the confluence of Disappearing Creek and Goddard Creek, look across the creek. It's all granite. In fact, the splendid granite that you see there is similar to the granite found on Cathedral Peak in Yosemite National Park. Just upstream are some spectacular waterfalls carved in granite.\r\n\r\nHeading up Goddard Canyon, you will leave behind the splendid granite and jump right into the metarhyolite tuff again. But don't despair, the wonderful Sierra granite is not far away. Climb up past numerous waterfalls about half-way up Goddard Canyon, and soon you will find yourself in the upper canyon surrounded by expansive granite slabs.\r\n\r\nActually, the rock in upper Goddard canyon is a granodiorite, not true granite. (Mount Reinstein is composed of the same granodiorite.) Granodiorite contains more plagioclase than feldspar, and often has a darker appearance than true granite.\r\n\r\nClimbing up to the Ionian Basin, you will once again pass through metarhyolite tuff, metadacite and metarhyolite before encountering Goddard granite.\r\n", "Descending the Enchanted Gorge": "\u00a0\r\nIonian Basin\u00a0\r\nHiking through benches\u00a0\r\nHalfway: A Large Round Lake\u00a0\r\nBreaking out of the chasm\u00a0\r\nThe Lower Gorge\r\nA descent of the Enchanted Gorge begins in the fabled Ionian Basin. This is an isolated lake basin ringed with a high ridge (as if the Enchanted Gorge wasn't isolated enough). If you climb onto this ridge via Wanda Pass, you will be rewarded with a view down into the Enchanted Gorge.\r\n\r\nFrom Chasm Lake in the Ionian Basin, proceed to the outlet of the lake and follow Disappearing Creek down into the Enchanted Gorge. This section of the gorge is wide open fields of talus. Early in the season you will be able to glissade on snow fields.\r\n\r\nAfter the talus fields you will encounter several benches separated by cliffs. You will have to pick your way down through the cliffs. Which side of the creek is best? There is no correct answer. One side may give you clear sailing for a while, but then you round a corner there is a cliff blocking your path.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way down the gorge you will pass numerous tarns and one large, round lake. They are incredibly clear and green. It is worthwhile stopping and camping here. Why not slow down and savor a night in the heart of the Enchanted Gorge?\r\n\r\nDeep in the middle of the Enchanted Gorge the walls close in and things can get challenging. Early in the season (i.e., through July) Disappearing Creek is covered by a thick snow pack (avalanche debris from the winter's snow fall). The snow permits rapid travel down the gorge, but beware of thin snow bridges! Later in the season when the snow is gone, good luck! You will have to find your way around the cliffs and the creek.\r\n\r\nOnce you break out of the narrow chasm, the gradient of the creek flattens and the valley floor is filled with cobble stones and brush. Here it is probably easiest to travel on the east side of the creek, but you had better get back on the west side of Disappearing Creek for the final descent to Goddard Creek. If the creek is running so high as to prevent you from portaging across the creek, you will have to stay on the west side.\r\n\r\nOn the west side of the creek, there are cliffs that repeatedly force you to bush whack high above the creek. Then another cliff will force you back down to the creek. You will climb up and down, up and down, thrashing through brush and briar the entire time. Oh yeah, watch for the stinging nettle! Did I mention the need for plenty of good antiseptic for all of your scratches?\r\n\r\nThe final drop to Goddard Creek is extremely steep. There are cliffs on the east side of Disappearing Creek, so make the final descent on the west side. In fact, if you stay high and \"cut the corner\" as you make the turn north into Goddard Canyon, you can avoid the steepest slopes. Take a good look at the topo map.\r\n\r\nThe confluence of Disappearing Creek and Goddard Creek is a beautiful area, surrounded by high granite cliffs and waterfalls.

There\u2019s a reason so few people have ever seen the canyon.  The descent is a trial.  Seldom can the passage be described as even remotely easy.

Cloudland Canyon was originally called Sitton Gulch, but changed names in 1939 when the state began buying parcels of land around the area and officially designated the land as a state park. Sitton Gulch Creek which runs through the park is the only remnant of that original name. Now comprising over 3,800 acres, the lands encompassed by the park are some of the most scenic views in the state. \r\n\r\nThere are two main trails that run through the park. Most notably is the ~5 mile East Canyon Rim Trail, that takes you past two waterfalls, as well as around the rim of the canyon. While the distance is not terribly long, there are some fairly steep elevation changes as you drop 900' into the bottom of the canyon and then climb back out. There are many well-developed observation points that look into the canyon from the trail. Keep a sharp eye out for side-trails off of the main trail that lead to these points. While the side-trails are well-maintained, they are not marked. There is also a shorter 2 mile backcountry trail that also passes some small waterfalls. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ", "Created/Edited": "May19,2007/Jun24,2007", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=34.83555&amp;distance_lon_9=-85.47906&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">34.83555\u00b0N/85.47906\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Red Tape": "Like all of the Georgia State Parks, there is a daily use fee for parking anywhere within the park.

It involves one long rappel, a very cold, but short, swim and quite a bit of chimney technique used  in descending its narrow slots.    Although fixed gear has been placed in Yankee Doodle before, it has all since been removed in 2008 except for the fixed rap station at the start.  It was a great source of angst among locals when some guide bolted it, but thank goodness reason won out and those bolts have since been removed.

At the top of the 170\u2019 cliff are several sets of solid anchors.  Two are located in the middle of the pour-off, two are located 30 feet to the north, and two are located 30 feet east of the edge of the pour-off on the backside of a large boulder.  There is evidence of old \u00bc inch bolts that have been chopped both at the top of the pour-off, and also at the top of a prominent crack that ascends the right (south) side of the pour-off.\n\nThere is climbing at the large granite face as well.  The low-angle crack that ascends the right side of the face shows evidence of climbing.  There is also a line of bolts up the center of the slab.  On the rock below the center of the slab is a single bolt, presumably for a belayer.  Unfortunately, I was unable to find any information about difficulty ratings or names.  If anyone has that information, please post it on the addition section of this page and I will be happy to add that here.\n\nOther recreational opportunities include Mountain Biking and Geo-Caching.   This open space provides access for Mountain Bikers to the Foothills Trail and Trail #365.  Several Geo-Caches are located in the area, but specific details are beyond the scope of this author.\n\nThere is an abundance of wildlife in the canyon, although they are difficult to spot.  Mule Deer spoor, including both tracks and scat, are everywhere.  Unfortunately, the deer themselves are hard to spot due to their well-camouflaged hides, and the density of the brush.  Coyotes and fox frequent the area as well, but are rarely seen.  Bird species include Canyon Wren, Mountain Chickadee, Northern Flicker, Dark-eyed Junco, and Crissal Thrasher.  Rattlesnakes are extremely common in this canyon, so caution must be exercised during the warmer months.\n\nThe canyon is also home to plant species such as the ubiquitous Chamisa bush with its bright yellow fall blooms, the Cholla cactus, Mountain Mahogany (a favorite of the Mule Deer), various Juniper species (higher up the canyon), and a wide association of riparian plants found in the canyon bottom.\n\nThe American Canyoneering Academy Rating system would consider this canyon very easy at 1A I meaning that it is a non-technical dry canyon that can be accomplished in just a few hours.

The trail is an approximately 3.8 mile (round trip), heavily forested route that winds its way from the end of the paved road, through the canyon, and eventually connects with the Skyline Drive dirt road at Sunset Park. The trail starts at 5250 feet and ends at Sunset Park at 6425 feet (1175 foot gain). Trail traffic is sparse and most of the time you'll have the canyon to yourself.\n\nDuring the summer, mornings and evenings are best times to hike as the trail gets a good deal of sun--it gets hot; bring water. Shoeshoes are recommended for winter hikes up the canyon because the trail doesn't get beaten down with too much traffic. You can expect snow into early April.\n\nOverall, the trail is straight forward.  Park in the dirt parking lot at the end of the paved road. The trailhead is very obvious and on the north side of the parking lot. From there, as you head generally east, the trail climbs steadily as it winds through the canyon.  You will cross the creek twice, once at about 3/4 mile and once at about 1.5 miles into the hike.  \n\nAs you head up the canyon, keep your eyes peeled for destroyed 1940, 50, and 60s vehicles that rolled off the road, fell 500-1000 feet, and ended up in the forest (there's at least 4 of them along the route!). There are several other points of interest along the way including Farmington Cave early in the hike and a waterfall toward the end.

Fall Canyon is in that last category.\r\n\r\nFall Canyon is no secret but is overshadowed by its well-known neighbor Titus Canyon, through which many people drive.  Just a short hike north from the mouth of Titus Canyon is the mouth of Fall Canyon, though, and it offers equally good scenery without the noise and the danger of being run over as you round a bend in the narrows!\r\n\r\nOnly a little bit of easy scrambling is required to reach the narrows, so this is a canyon suited to nearly all ages and ability levels.\r\n\r\nNote: the next two canyons north of Fall Canyon, Red Wall Canyon and Palmer Canyon, are supposed to be even more spectacular (and more isolated).

Then just head \"upstream\" on the gravel.  The canyon walls quickly become high, but the canyon mostly stays quite open.  There are, however, some interesting-looking side canyons.  One branching left as one heads upstream narrows and ends in a two-step dryfall.  This canyon junction is where a high, island-like outcrop stands in the main wash.\r\n\r\nAbout 2.9 miles from the trailhead is a dryfall just beyond where the canyon finally tightens into true narrows.  Climbing this dryfall, which is about 15-20' high, looks difficult but not impossible.  However, if you backtrack to before the start of the narrows and look to the south side of the wash, you will see a cairned trail (see photo below).  At first, the trail climbs steeply and has some Class 3 spots, but it soon levels out and then parallels the canyon, dropping back into the wash just above the dryfall.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond that point, the canyon features a nice section of narrows for about a mile before opening up again.

However, many of those canyons lie on private lands, or are very remote, making them difficult to access.  One beautiful canyon in the southern Black Hills, Cold Brook Canyon, has 6 to 7 miles of public access, giving hikers a good opportunity to explore a good representative sampling of a southern Black Hills canyon.\r\n\r\nThe upper reaches of the Cold Brook watershed are located in Custer County, southwest of the town of Custer.  Cold Brook Canyon is joined by numerous small side canyons, most notably Antelope Canyon and Wildcat Canyon.  Cold Brook joins Hot Brook at the north edge of Hot Springs, to form the Fall River.  While there are many springs along the canyon, there is little or no regular stream flow in Cold Brook, unlike Hot Brook, which is fed by many thermal springs.  Cold brook\u2019s drainage area is large enough that some very significant storm runoffs can and do create hazardous conditions on the canyon floor. \r\n\u00a0Cold Brook Canyon Prairie Dogs\r\nCold Brook Canyon is characterized by forested slopes and limestone and sandstone walls that vary in height from less than 100 feet to over 200 feet in other places.  Caves are common in the canyon, along with a variety of rock formations.  While ponderosa pine is the most common tree in the region, other varieties of trees include aspen, birch, cottonwood, oak, ash and spruce.  Deer are the most commonly seen large animals in the canyon.  But, visitors to the canyon might also see elk, pronghorn, bison, mountain lions and coyotes.  Smaller animals are abundant in the canyon, particularly prairie dogs.  Foxes, bobcats, porcupines, raccoons, skunks, eagles and a variety of snakes are often seen in and around the canyon.  Rattlesnakes are of particular concern, and Wind Cave National Park posts notices to that effect. \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Oct8,2014/Jun30,2016", "Cold Brook Lake": "From the time the city of Hot Springs was formed in the late 1800\u2019s, occasional flash floods on the Fall River were problematic.  This went on for many years, until the Army Corps of Engineers built dams on the two major forks of the Fall River \u2013 Cold Brook Reservoir and Cottonwood Springs Reservoir (on the Hot Brook watershed).  In 1953, a 127 foot high dam was built in Cold Brook Canyon, on the north edge of Hot Springs, creating Cold Brook Lake.\r\n\r\nSince then, the lake has provided not only flood control for Hot Springs, but also recreational opportunities in the form of fishing, canoeing, camping and swimming.  The lake has a popular beach on the southwest shoreline.  In the winter, outdoor enthusiasts can ice fish, ice skate and cross country ski in the area.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Flood DebrisConsidering there is no regular stream flow in Cold Brook, seeing all the water in the lake is rather amazing.  However, when one sees the caches of flood debris wedged in along streambed trees in the canyon, it becomes apparent that there are some pretty substantial floods that occur following heavy rainfalls.  This is also a reminder of the importance of not hiking in the canyon immediately following heavy rain in the area.\r\n", "Public Exploration Routes & How to Get to Each": "Cold Brook Canyon Trail Route + Option\r\n\r\nCold Brook Canyon Trail:  \u00a0Trailhead Greeting CommitteeThe Cold Brook Canyon Trail at Wind Cave National Park is the only defined and marked trail in Cold Brook Canyon.

The trail winds down through some trees to the floor of Cold Brook Canyon, and mostly follows the canyon floor for 1.4 miles to Fossil Ridge.  This is an easy hike, but be on the lookout for bison and rattlesnakes.  About halfway to Fossil Ridge, there is a sizable prairie dog town about 100 yards north of the trail.  When you get to Fossil Ridge, the only way to explore further up the canyon is to climb the 7-foot high fence and hike to Song Dog Road, about 200 yards west, and go to FSR682.2A (route listed below).\r\n\r\nIf you wish to explore further down the canyon, you can do an easy bushwhack on the canyon floor once you pass the location where the trail drops into the canyon.

Best choice is one of those at Le Rozier.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "The Gorge de la Jonte (engl. Jonte gorge) is a slightly unknown climbing spot at southern france close to the well known Gorge du Tarn at the Cevennes-mountains. It offers some very good climbing possibilities in a fantastic setting.\r\n\r\nAbove the small village of Le Rozier at the junction of the rivers Tarn and Jonte the Gorge de la Jonte goes up direction NE for about 20 kilometres to Meyrueis. The Jonte is a tributary of the Tarn rising on Mont Aigoual above Meyrueis. On the heights either side of the Gorge de la Jonte are the so called Grands Causses. At a height of 1000m, Causse Mejean opens onto a vast steppe of yellow grassland as fascinating as the desert. Its landscapes dotted with typical hamlets of shingled roofs and shepherds huts rise and fall as far as the eye can see.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of the gorge consist of big rock cliffs up to 300 m height. One characteristic thing are the Vases, rock formations looking like vases growing on a small shaft from the ground (one of the climbing sectors is calles \"Sector des Vases\").\r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Apr5,2004/Feb6,2010", "General Climbing Informations": "Rock Quality\r\nThe rock is perfect for climbing: a mixture of limestone and sandstone provides a very good rock quality with a a lot of big holds.

There is also some adventure area (no bolt, only pitons or nothing, so bring nuts, friends etc.). Those are clearly marked in the topo guide (\"Terr d'Av\"). The usage of a helmet shoulb be obvious ...\r\n\r\nType of climbing\r\nThe climbing is every time steep and needs some (or even a lot of) power. Most climbs are face climbs but there are alos some cracks and even a off-width (mjam ... ). The demanding protection together with the high and the steepness makes the climbing often a bit challenging for the leader but gives great satisfaction too.\r\n\r\nThere are single pitch and multi pitch (up to 6 pitches) routes from 4c up to 8b+ (5.8 up to 5.14 a). There are less climbing areas with \"easy\" routes (up to 5c) of the quality of those at the Gorge de la Jonte.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "External Links": "", "Roquefort": ".

{"Routes Overview": "There is currently only one recommended route through Pine Creek and drops into the canyon right at the highway.      The route has several rappels (5-8 depending on the route and group).    Conditions vary tremendously.     Sometimes the canyon is a dry romp and sometimes it is filled with ice cold water.        Flash floods change the canyon periodically and in fact a few years ago one of the old rappels actually disappeared and was taken out by a huge flash flood.     \r\n\r\nThe canyon included some dark passageways, so for the best lighting, an 11 am start is recommended.       The canyon begins right at the highway and then the canyon quickly slots up and has several drops and obstacles.      The convoluted walls are really nice and the passages interesting.     The slot opens up after the last drop and then there is an hour or two ob boulderhopping to get to the lower trailhead.     Most parties seem to take about 4 hours for the route.    See the Route Page for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the rappel into what is known as the Double Arch Cavern or the Great Cathedral.\r\n", "Activities": "Hiking,Bouldering,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "Pine Creek (along with Fry Canyon much farther east), actually has the easiest access of any slot canyon I know of.     The slot actually passes under the highway!\r\n\r\nLower Trailhead\r\n\r\nThis is where you will exit the canyon.     If hitch hiking, you will probably want to start here as you will be clean and dry before doing the canyon.\r\n\r\nAfter obtaining the proper permit from the visitor center, drive up Zion Canyon to Highway 9.     Turn right/east here and follow the road to the second switchback.       Park here.\r\n\r\nNote:      Observe the surrounding landmarks so you will know the correct place to exit the canyon after completing it.        \r\n\r\nUpper Trailhead\r\n\r\nContinue up Highway 9.     Go through the tunnel and park at the parking lot just east of it and right after exiting the tunnel. \r\n\r\nInside Pine Creek.\r\n", "Camping": "There is no camping in Pine Creek.      You must camp in one of two campgrounds in Zion Canyon or on BLM land surrounding the park.     ", "Overview": "\n            Pine Creek is a beautiful slot canyon with a strange history and some surprises.      Pine Creek Canyon itself actually host Highway 9 through Zion National Park, but the slot itself is bypassed by a long tunnel blasted out of the rock in the 1930\u2019s.      While descending the slot, you can sometimes hear traffic rumbling through the tunnel and radiating from the blasted windows high above the slot.\r\n\r\nThe slot canyon itself is a lot of fun and short and sweet.     The canyon provides a lot of \u201cbang for the buck\u201d and so is one of the most popular technical canyons in Zion National Park.      The park service limits the amount of people that can descend the canyon, so get a permit in advance or be prepared to wait in line at the visitor center very early in the morning. \r\n\r\nIf you have a half a day to kill while in the park, Pine Creek is well worth the time.     An added attraction is the coolness of the slot.       When we went through, the temperature in Zion Canyon was 111F (44C), but the slot was very pleasant.      The hike out wasn\u2019t bad either with all the swimming holes to take a cool dip.      Sometimes the canyon is filled with several refrigerator cold swimming holes, even in summer.\r\n\r\nCompared to many canyons, Pine Creek is more a hike with rappels than it is a true technical canyon.        Even though the technical challenges are few, don\u2019t get the wrong idea that this canyon is for the inexperienced. It would be foolhardy for anyone to try and descend Pine Creek without the proper skills. There have already been several parties rescued from the canyon-don\u2019t be another one.     Pine Creek and the Subway seem to have more rescues than any canyon in the Park and sometimes attract a lot of people that shouldn\u2019t be there and the canyon could easily be fatal for anyone whom makes the wrong mistakes.      The canyon has a lot of flash flood potential and is not the place to be when thunderstorms are present in the area.     \r\n\r\nThis canyon is highly recommended for those that have the proper skills needed, but whom are not ready for challenging canyons elsewhere in Zion or on the Colorado Plateau. At a minimum every member of the group should be well versed in rope skills used by rock climbers and especially in rappelling.    The canyon now sees many parties in the May through October season.\r\n\r\nThis canyon is justifiably popular and a beautiful route. Highlights include a long and interesting narrows, dark passages, high walls, arches, pools of water and then greenery and several cascades and pools in the last section and after the slot.     \r\n\r\nNote #1:   The slot is pretty dark and hard to photograph.       Forgive the poor quality photographs as they didn\u2019t turn out as well as hoped. \r\n\r\nNote #2:   Pine Creek already has plenty of bolts.

This endangered species of fish survive the brutal summer months retreating up the stream as necessary.

You can cross Pike Creek here by jumping the stream where you'll find the trail on the other side.  Immediately obvious is Pike Rock looming above the mouth of the canyon, a distinctive outcropping at 5800 feet.  Below Pike Rock and across the canyon you will see a series of caves cutting into and through weathered crags.  These are apparently pilot holes dug as part of the exploratory mining undertaken at various points along the old roadbed.  A mile further up this old road you will find a more developed mining site with an old shack alongside the cliff.  According to William Sullivan's Eastern Oregon Guide this was a prospect site for Uranium, likely due to the fact that rocks along Steens Mountain's eastern base have risen from deep within the Earth's crust to the surface over the last several million years.\r\n\r\nBeyond the mine site, the road crosses to the north side of Pike Creek and switchbacks up the hillside then resumes a short distance up the canyon.

It is located in the south of the Angathes Range which stretches between Cretes two highest mountain ranges, The Levka Ori and the Ida Range with Crete's highest mountain, Psiloritis.  Unlike the more famous gorges in the Levka Ori - Agia Irini, Samaria and Aradena - the ones in the Angathes Range are shorter and less profound. \r\n\r\nHowever, they still are excellent hiking destinations and by connecting two into a loop you will be busy as long as with the longer gorges in the west.

The KAllikratiano Gorge follows a profound creek, which still carries water in the upper northern part. But once the first cascades have dropped into the gorge all water vanishes. The gorge connects the mountain village of Kallikratiano with the old fortress (and now resort town) of Frangocastello. The gorge-like part is some 7km long, starting and ending several km from the respective villages.\r\n\r\nThanks to its usage as connecting route between the villages in the past, the gorge has well kept trails at its bottom. The narrowest and steepest parts in some places even are paved - in others you can find long ramps. The main part, however is regular rocky hiking terrain, which in the lower part gets sometimes a bit tricky to orientate in.

Though located in the remote Glen Canyon National Recreation Area of Southern Utah, Coyote Gulch is worth the time and effort required to visit, and worthy of its famed status.  While exploring Coyote Gulch, you will see the landscape much the same way that the Anasazi culture and early Western explorers, soldiers, and settlers did.  Characterized by sparkling streams, impossible arches, and daunting vertical walls of Navajo Sandstone, you will be raving about this canyon for years after your trek.  Plunge yourself into the heart of geologic time as you contemplate the eons that have preceded your insignificant life span.  How will you navigate these emotional floods of humility and adventure as you gaze over the matchless beauty before you?  \n", "Created/Edited": "Feb8,2008/Jun18,2014", "Getting There & Trailheads": "The closest town to Coyote Gulch is Escalante, Utah which is remote in and of itself.  Goods and services should be available there.  Escalante is located on State Highway 12, which is the same highway that makes a big loop between Bryce Canyon National Park and Capitol Reef National Park.  Escalante is about 41 Miles East of the Bryce Canyon turnoff, and about 118 miles East from Cedar City on I-15.  The entire route is a scenic byway.  Or if you are coming from the East on I-70, you can exit at Sigurd and follow State Scenic Byway 24, which eventually turns into Highway 12.  The distance from I-70 is about 130 miles.  Either way, you will definitely want a road map to follow.  \n\nJust about 5 miles East of the town of Escalante, Highway 12 makes a big U curve from SE to NE.  At the bottom of the U, you will be exiting the highway to the South on a large, maintained dirt road.  Coming from the East, this road is about 5.5 miles from Boulder.  The road is called Glen Canyon Recreation Area Road.  It also used to be called Hole-in-the-Rock Road.  You should be heading SE on this road.  Fortymile Mountain will be on your right as you travel down this road.  You will continue down this road between 30 to 35 miles, depending on where you will begin your hike.  \n\nCAUTION:  The roads to these trailheads may be washed out or have stretches of soft sand.  A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended.\n\nHere's a link for Scenic Highway 12\n\nA Link for Hole-in-the-Rock Road\n\nLower Coyote Gulch via Fortymile Ridge Trailhead\n\nThis is the approach you will want to take if you intend on only exploring the lower portion of Coyote Gulch.  This happens to be the longest drive between all the routes.  You will drive SE on Glen Canyon Recreation Area Road for 35 miles from Highway 12.  You will take a road that turns to the left called Fortymile Ridge Road.  This road definitely has deep sand in places.  You will follow this road for 7 miles to the trailhead parking lot.  There will only be one intersection along the way, where you will stay left.  \n\nHurricane Wash Trailhead\n\nThis is probably the easiest entry into Coyote Gulch.  This trailhead is about 33 miles from Highway 12.  There are no roads to turn off onto.  When you are approaching this trailhead you will see a turnout to your left that leads to a livestock corral.  Immediately after this turnout, there will be another turnout to your right.  Pull off here: this is your destination.  You have already parked in the dry Hurricane Wash.  Just head downstream (East) from here.  \n\nHurricane Wash.  Submitted by tp\n\n\nRed Well Trailhead\n\nAn alternative to Hurricane Wash, Red Well takes a different dry wash into the Coyote Gulch.  The turnoff for Red Well is 30 miles from Highway 12.  The turnoff will be to the left.  There should be a sign for the turnoff.  Take this turnoff for a little over a mile where you will come to a fork.  Take the left fork, which will finally end in a turnaround less than a mile later.  \n\n", "Water": "\u00a0\n Photo by gjagiels\n\nThere is no water at the trailheads.  You will have to rely on natural water sources.  Springs can be found inside the canyon.  Heading downstream, the first one is found just past Jacob Hamblin Arch.

Submitted by Baarb Eventually, the trail becomes slickrock and you will have to keep an eye out for a cairn on the rim of the Coyote Gulch that marks the location of the crack-in-the-wall.  Crack-in-the-wall is a slice of sandstone that has broken off from the canyon wall and has created a nice pathway from the top of the rim to the giant sand slide below.   Crack-in-the-wall is narrow enough that you will have to remove your pack as you slide through.  From here, it is a 700-foot descent from the top of the sandslide down to the stream.  (See Below.)  Stay to the left of the large sandstone formation in the middle of the slide.  If you go to the right of the formation, you will find a nice overlook of the Escalante River.  Please stay on the trail to help prevent excessive erosion.  Once down at the bottom, you can follow Coyote Gulch downstream to the Escalante River.  From the trailhead to the Escalante River, the distance is 2 miles.  Of course, you can trek upstream through Coyote Gulch, if you desire.  Many who go this direction often exit the canyon by ascending some slickrock near Jacob Hamblin Arch.  Once out of the canyon, you will travel cross-country back to the parking lot.

In about 5 miles the road turns to sand and becomes Coyote Canyon Road.  From here high-clearance and 4wd is recommended.  The road crosses the creek in several places.  Many vehicles park at 1st Crossing and people hike from there, but if you have high clearance and 4wd you can proceed to 2nd Crossing.  During a wet year the road after 2nd Crossing may be very tough to negotiate, so many vehicles choose to stop here.  If you choose to drive further at 3rd Crossing the \"road\" is pretty much in the creek itself and the water can be high.  After 3rd Crossing the road departs from the creekbed and ascends a canyon that is very, very rocky and all but the toughest of vehicles and most experienced of drivers proceed this far.  After ascending the canyon, however, the road turns to sand again and the rest of the way up Collins Valley is fairly easy.  As an alternative hikers can follow the creek through an area called Lower Willows, but the hike can be quite soggy.  The creek bed and road rejoin near Santa Catarina Spring.

In the springtime this area receives a lot of visitors because of its vast and beautiful wildflower displays.  The area called Desert Gardens is a nice spot to see the flowers and explore the desert landscape. Wildflowers include sand verbena, desert lily, evening primrose, desert dandelion, phacelia, chuparosa, and chicory.  \r\n\r\nWhen wildflowers aren't in season the landscape is dominated by creosote bushes, ocotillo, and cholla and barrel cactus with willows and sycamores along the creeks.  In the higher canyons native fan palm oasis beckon.  There is a lot of wildlife including coyote, fox, bighorn sheep, frogs near the creek, and various species of migratory birds, desert reptiles, and rodents.  \r\n\r\nThose who own a Jeep Wrangler or similar very high-clearance 4wd vehicle can drive up the canyon all the way up Coyote Canyon to Collins Valley and Middle Willows.  Hikers can use the road as well, or hike along one of many user trails paralleling it.  The area above Collins Valley splits into several canyons very much worth exploring on foot.  These include Indian, Cougar, and Sheep Canyons.  In the springtime there is usually plenty of water in these canyons, as well as water further down Coyote Canyon.  But it doesn't flow everywhere - sometimes the water disappears under sandy stretches of the wash.  In the upper reaches of the canyons the water often flows year-round - if just a trinkle in the late summer and fall.  \r\n\r\nIn the 1770's the Anza party camped at Santa Catarina Spring beside Lower Willows. In the 1880s, an American cattleman named Joel Reed claimed squatters rights and built a home at Santa Catarina Spring. He spent a good portion of the rest of his life protecting his claim. Indeed, a man named John Collins took possession of the area for a while in 1910 while Reed was away. Unfortunately for Reed, this was also the year they drew up the maps.

AND WATCH THOSE HOLES ! make sure they are good and haven't got rounded out), then 10-15\u2019 of aid climbing on talons and etriers to skinny unprotected ledges 10\u2019 below and 10\u2019 beside a glowingly beautiful bolt and hanger. Penalty points are high to move to it but it is not a hard move for those used to climbing. Once clipped in descend and traverse to another glowingly beautiful bolt and hanger ~20\u2019 over and 10\u2019 below. Then a little pendulum action to swing over to the far lip. Yay ! Then ferry the rest over. Or sloooooowly peck hook holes and etrier out from the bottom. THESE BOLTS ARE 30 YEARS OLD, BE CAREFUL IF TRUSTING THEM. potshots have been used to overcome the crux pothole. If you are unable to successfully bridge the gap that way though, up you go. So be prepeared. There is also another keeper pothole beyond the crux pothole which is rather nasty. There is a bypass up high on a ledge above and beyond it, but the wart outcropping that has been slung before is not very stable. Either a direct approach into the pothole and out on potshots, or a bolt or other alternative anchor up high is necessary.

The second rap has some tricky anchoring.\r\n\r\nAfter completing Poncho you can explore Muddy Creek or return to the car before climbing out the rigorous exit chute, followed by a cross country walk back to the trailhead.       The round trip distance is around 6-7 miles.

You must do the vehicle shuttle the day before the trip, as it will be a long day just getting through the canyon. You absolutely must have the 7.5 minute quads (maps) Big Bend Draw and Ireland Mesa for the drive to the trailhead. Even then, the maps are inaccurate especially near the trailhead. A 4wd is also required. \r\n\r\nTo get to the trailhead at the head of the canyon, drive west from Green River or east of the Emery area along I-70 to exit 108. You must carefully follow the topo maps for the remainder of the drive. Take the southbound gravel road and veer right after a short distance. Stay on the main road until you reach Kimball Draw at an intersection with a sign. This is at about co-ordinates N38*47'16.47\" W111*5'52.69\". Turn left onto the dirt road signposted for Copper Globe. After following the bottom of the wash for a while, you will reach an intersection (no sign and it can be hard to spot [update:  in 2007, there was a sign for \"Designated Vehicle Route\" here]) at about co-ordinates N38*47'4.42\" W111*4'34.19\". Turn right onto a seldom used track. Follow the track in and out of several drainages until you reach an intersection at a top of a hill at about co-ordinates N38*46'24.02\" W111*3'57.04\". Turn right here. The road weaves in and out of drainages and scenic and colorful badlands and is one of the most interesting pieces of road construction I've ever seen. There are some sections of the road that pass through sparkling gypsum beds. Not too far after the road climbs out of Dizzy Trail Canyon (see the topo map), you will reach a junction next to a small hill with a cairn (pile of rocks) on top. \r\n\r\nFrom here on, the topo map is inaccurate as far as showing the many tracks go, so pay attention closely to the topographic features on the map. There are many routes to the trailhead, but here's the route we took. Turn right at the junction with the hill and cairn. You will cross a few very rough spots in the road while crossing two washes.  Continue past the rough washes as mentioned above and park at the stock tank in Poncho Wash.\r\n\r\nMake sure to leave Green River or Castle Dale with a full tank of gas!

The first recorded descent of this canyon did not occur until April 2007. Only a handful of people have seen this canyon. This is a rugged technical adventure. The trip is not for beginners. Just finding the trailhead is a serious test of navigation. Climbers and canyoneers should go well prepared before considering this trip. \r\n\r\nAlthough pretty, the wildness of the canyon is its main attraction.      As far as technical canyons in the region go, this one is not one of the best and is just another average canyon.     The only slot last a few yards and most of the canyon is deep and pretty, though fairly wide and with a few interesting raps, and has no real special features to ever make it a classic.      I have done Poncho Wash once and would probably not do it again.\r\n\r\nAfter debating it for a few months, I decided to add the canyon to Summitpost.      It\u2019s just another average canyon, but I guess all canyons are worth doing once.      When in the area, I would suggest doing the Gem Canyons and Enigma Canyon first as they are more spectacular.       \r\n\r\nThe Getting There and Route Description sections are meant to be brief as everyone heading out into this wild area must be self-sufficient.      \r\n\r\nThis is the final big rap in Poncho Wash.", "Clean Canyoneering Ethics": "The canyons in this area are very pristine.

Tulare Lake was at one time the largest lake west of the Mississippi.  The Kern, Tule, and Kings  Rivers also filled up this lake in historic times.  \r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the Kaweah River was named after the Gawia Tribe that lived near the small town of Woodlake.

At about the boundary between Sequoia National Park and Sequoia National Forest it takes on a river V-shape.  Shortly thereafter it is joined by the Little Kern River whose entire watershed is within the Golden Trout Wilderness.  Once it reaches the area near Lake Isabella, it joins with the South Fork then changes direction and makes a right-hand turn and then flows on to Bakersfield.  In historic times it filled up Buena Vista Lake but nowadays most of the water is used for domestic and agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nThe South Fork originates on the Kern Plateau and descends through deep gorges with large granite outcroppings and domes interspersed with open meadows. It is habitat for the golden trout, the state fish of California, and the only fish native to the High Sierra. \r\n\r\nThe Kern River splits the Sierra Nevada into two distinct sub-ranges: to the west is the Great Western Divide and to the east is the Sierra Crest.\r\n\r\nBoth Forks of the Kern River are designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers.  The North Fork from the Tulare-Kern County line to its headwaters in Sequoia National Park and the South Fork from its headwaters in the Inyo National Forest to the southern boundary of the Domeland Wilderness in the Sequoia National Forest were designated as Wild and Scenic on November 24, 1987.  \r\n\r\nThe area around Lake Isabella is unique as it's where 5 bioregions converge.

The sides of the gorge are mostly dead vertical, and are formed of solid granite with few of the typical signs of stream erosion - no wavy forms or pot-holes here, just a little bit of rounding off of the corners of some cracks.  The stream has not worked any great excavations above or below the gorge.\r\n\r\n  The geological explanation is that the Gorge is a sort of fossilized remnant or cast of a basalt dike.  Magma once flowed into a crack in the granite, widening it slightly.

In this picture you can only see the beginnings of the falls (you will have to go over very steep slick rock to even see the big waterfall). The falls have vertical slick rock on both sides. For the hiker this area is a dead end (obviously with proper equipment and training you can pass these falls). We spent 6 hours trying to find a route around the falls. The slopes on the east side of the falls were covered by a truly impenetrable growth of thorny bushes under the trees. The forested slopes on the west side of the falls were steep and muddy.

If you attempt to follow the creek, you will see nothing but extremely frustrating bushwhacking, not worth a fight.\r\nBushwhacking, if you miss the trail\r\n\r\nTrail in the Meadows & Forest\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the log bridge to the east side, go up the slopes to reach a meadow. You might find a cattle holding area here. The trail follows up the meadows and enters a forest on the edge of the upper slopes of the canyon (Do not follow another trail that keeps going up the forested slopes away from the canyon). The trail then goes down the forested slopes to return to the creek.\r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to the Canyon Floor & Side Waterfall\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the canyon floor, you will find it much wider. This beautiful waterfall will be seen on the east side.\r\n      Waterfall Canyon Floor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFighting Lizards\r\n\r\nAt first, these lizards did not even seem to notice that we were standing right above them. I think the aggressor finally noted us and let go of the victim allowing them to both run away. \r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nEnd of the Canyon\r\n\r\nThe canyon floor turns into a wide bed of medium size rock. A dirt road and small water management facilities appear. You will notice that the creek seems to have vanished away. It is probably diverted away. \r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCaspian Coastal Plain\r\n\r\nYou are suddenly out of the mountains and on the coastal plain.

You are somewhere near \u201cSisangan National Forest\u201d roughly 40 Km east of the coastal town of Chalus. Unlike the beautiful sandy beaches in other parts of the Caspian Coast, the beach here is covered by medium size rock. Walking barefoot on the hot rocks after several days of hiking is not a pleasant experience but at least you can get in the water and wash the mud and grime away. \r\n      \u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Click for Introduction to the Central Alborz Mountains.\r\n\r\nClick for a Detailed Map of the Central Alborz Mountains.\r\n\r\nAlborz Mountains\r\n\r\nThe Alborz Mountains rise very abruptly above the southern coast of the Caspian Sea trapping the moist air generated by the sea. Unlike the bare southern slopes, the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are covered by a lush growth of deciduous forest. On their mad rush to reach the sea, countless streams and rivers have dug canyon of various proportions into the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains.\r\n\r\nKojoor Plateau & Kojoor Canyon\r\n\u00a0Kojoor Plateau\r\nKojoor Plateau is a small plain that sits at an elevation of 1500 m among the peaks of the Alborz Mountains roughly 22 Km south of the Caspian Sea Coast. Although the mountains that surround the Kojoor plateau are forested, the plateau itself remains tree-less.\r\n\r\nKojoor Creek originates in the mountains south of the Kojoor Plateau and heads north. After crossing the plateau, it enters a canyon at the base of the 2626 m Ghal-eh Gardan Peak to the west and the 2327 m Valik Bon Peak to the east. It then continues north, cutting a deep canyon among the other peaks of the area until it drains into the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Near Perfect Wilderness\r\n\r\nAlthough local herdsmen do at times take their cattle into portions of the Kojoor Canyon, you will not find any permanent settlements in or near the canyon. This has caused the canyon to retain much of its wild character.\r\n\r\nWarning to Hikers\r\n\r\nFlash Floods can happen at any time in the Kojoor Canyon. Hikers have actually died as a result of these floods. The floods do create debris fields that are often quite tedious to traverse.\r\n\r\nIn the upper portions of the canyon the stream is quite small and will allow you to easily cross from one side of it to the other. In the lower canyon, the volume of the water does increase making the crossing more difficult (but usually possible). Be ready to get wet and to negotiate the many obstacles that the canyon throws at you. \r\n\r\nAlso be ware of the inviting trails that leave the canyon and head up the forested slopes. While some of these trails do make the hike much easier, others fade away in the forest. It is quite easy to get disoriented and become lost in the dense forest. \r\n\r\nMajor Obstacle\r\n\r\nAfter a day and a half of hiking we reached a waterfall. The waterfall is a dead end for the hiker (it can obviously be passed by those who have proper training and equipment). It took us 6 hours to find a way around the waterfall (We ended up roping ourselves down a wall on the side of the canyon, see more details below).\r\n\r\nHiking Distance and Hiking Time\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, low GPS signal in large portions of the canyon prevented me from obtaining an accurate hiking distance. On a straight line, the distance between the starting point (see below) and the Caspian Sea Coast is only 18 Km. I have read reports that claim a hiking time of as little as 16 hours. These reports do not give much detail and make no mention of the major obstacle mentioned above. It is possible that there might be trails in the forested slopes far above the canyon that can be followed. Except for 3 short segments of trail, we did not encounter any other viable trails. Hiking on the banks of the stream is extremely slow. Mistakenly following trails that fade away in the forest, will obviously waste much time. We made the hike in two and a half days (including the 6 hours we spent trying to find a way around the major obstacle noted above). \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Aug8,2009/Nov21,2016", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=36.50706&amp;distance_lon_9=51.75955&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">36.50706\u00b0N/51.75955\u00b0E</a>", "Season": "Summer", "Red Tape": "No permits needed.

Continue along NN rt 16 on a good paved road for about 30 miles or so (?). Shortly after passing the Navajo Mountain Mission the road will curve right and to the left will be visible some structures, a tall tower, and corrals. Turn left here onto dirt road, passing what appears to be a rodeo area and a water pump very quickly. Continue along the road until you see Haystack Rock, which looks like a big, rounded haystack. From here we went right at an intersection immediately before or after haystack rock and passed a water pump w/ residences nearby. We continued along rough, high clearance dirt road past the water pump until we came to the old Rainbow Lodge about 2-3 miles further. \u00a0old rainbow lodge at the south rainbow thWe left a vehicle here to hike out to. Back at Haystack Rock we continued down the dirt road, ignoring the numerous side roads, until we came to a place where we could see Round Rock out on the horizon above the flats. There is no exact way to tell you which road it is, but we could see a dirt road out in the distance heading to Round Rock and made a logical choice for our turn off. After a couple try's our pretzel logic paid off and we made Round Rock on dirt road that may require 4 wheel drive at times and high clearance definitely helps. This is where we began our hike.\r\n\r\nFrom Kayenta, AZ., head west on 160 to hwy 98.

Make sure you do to avoid creating ill will w/ the residents of the Navajo Nation who live nearby and graze cattle in upper Aztec Creek. Aztec Creek starts its flow some 20 miles or so south in Arizona and has carved a progressively deep, beautiful gorge along its way to the Colorado River and Lake Powell. Numerous side canyons join Aztec Creek from the east and make for way fun speed bumps to slow down-creek progress. The benches above Aztec Creek/Forbidding Canyon and below Cummings Mesa also invite aimless wandering and reward w/ spectacular views of the surrounding land to as far north as the Henry Mountains. Camping options exist throughout the drainage and all are spectacular. We went in April and water was just waaaaaaaay too cold for swimming w/out wetsuits, so it was a different type of trip bypassing the many long, water filled slots that would be welcome relief in warmer times. If going down the middle the longest drop is ~30-40'. Most can be slid or jumped into (test the water depth of course before blindly jumping). Wheeeeee ! \r\n\r\nNearby Rainbow Bridge is located in Rainbow Bridge Canyon, the result of Bridge Creeks determination, in an adjacent arm east of Forbidding Canyon.\r\n\r\nWe all had a fantastic time and i thoroughly enjoyed the company.

You won't be disappointed. One important tidbit tho - it is much easier to go down Aztec Creek to the new high water mark of Lake Powell than it is to go up. The reason being there is a spot shortly before the Aztec Creek/Cliff Canyon jct. That requires some serious team work or rope/aid to safely negotiate. There is a very steep (near vertical) slick grassy slope that goes about 10' ? 15' ? or so to an outcropping rock platform 6 feet above the creek. Water was low enough to stay dry for a few inches along the wall once down into Aztec Creek, and we lowered packs from above w/ rope once i got down, then looped a log for the last person down and retrieved. \u00a0wetherill inscriptionJust above here is an inscription Scott said is surely from John Wetherill who explored the region in the late 1800's i believe ? \u00a0moki wayThere are numerous moki steps to bypass deep water filled slots along the way as well, which we had no problems negotiating, but i guess it depends upon skill levels. \u00a0watery wayHaving one decent climber to then hand line assist others should make things happy happy joy joy. \u00a0high wayWe based at the Aztec Creek/Cliff Canyon jct. to day hike down to the new high water mark of Lake Powell and explore benches above. Then exited up cliff canyon to the waiting vehicle at the old Rainbow Lodge. Moving to the Cliff Canyon/Redbud Pass jct. was helpful in shortening the final hike out from that point. It is all uphill. Not hard hiking, but strenuous. We took 6 days car to car w/ wanderings. If all you want is Aztec/Forbidding you could maybe cut that in half if you pushed really hard, regardless of whether you go straight down the middle and do the slot swims, or bypass.\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Apr27,2009/Dec13,2009", "External Links": "navajo nation parks\r\n\r\nfull pics\r\n\r\nscotts trip report in here\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=37.06675&amp;distance_lon_9=-110.98140&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.06675\u00b0N/110.9814\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

This trail drops about 1,600' in 2 miles down to the confluence of the South and Middle Forks of the Kings River.  Most people do this trail in spring or fall because it is at a lower elevation that is hot in the summer!  Beware also of poison oak, ticks, and rattlesnakes.  A lot of fishermen like this trail but fishing is all catch-and-release here.  \r\n\r\nDon Cecil Trail\r\nThe Don Cecil Trail climbs the relatively cool north-facing slope of the canyon. This historic trail was the major access route to Cedar Grove prior to the completion of Highway 180 in 1939.\r\n\r\nSheep Creek Cascade\r\nA moderately strenuous hike up the forested Don Cecil Trail provides views of the Monarch Divide and leads to a shady glen on Sheep Creek. This two-mile round trip takes about 1 1/2 hours and gains 600' in elevation.\r\n\r\nLookout Peak\r\nBeyond Sheep Creek, the climb to Lookout Peak provides an incredible panorama of the park's backcountry. This strenuous, all-day hike is 13 miles round trip and climbs some 4000' to the summit.\r\n\r\nHotel Creek Trail\r\nThe cool of the morning is the best time to hike this trail, which climbs up the relatively dry, south-facing side of the canyon.\r\n\r\nCedar Grove Overlook\r\nThe trail switchbacks up through chaparral to a forested ridge and a rocky outcrop. This strenuous hike will reward you with a gorgeous view up and down Kings Canyon. A round trip of 5 miles with a 1200' elevation gain, this hike takes 3-4 hours to complete.\r\n\r\nHotel Creek - Lewis Creek Loop\r\nIf you continue 1 1/4 mile past the turn-off to Cedar Grove Overlook, the Hotel Creek Trail drops down to join the Lewis Creek Trail. This area was burned in 1980, in one of the largest fires these parks have experienced in recent years. The last 2 miles, from the Lewis Creek Trailhead back to your starting point, follow a trail above the roadway. This 8-mile round trip takes an average of 5 hours and gains 1200' to the highest point.\r\n\r\nMist Falls\r\nThis sandy trail follows the glaciated South Fork Canyon through forest and chaparral, past an impressive show of rapids and cascades, to one of the largest waterfalls in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. The first part of this 8-mile round trip is relatively flat; during the last mile to the falls, the trail gains 600'.

There are three forks of the Kings River - the North, Middle, and South - and they all start up near the Sierra Crest.  The North Fork starts in the Sierra National Forest and the Middle and South start in Kings Canyon National Park.  The confluence of the South Fork and Middle Forks of the Kings River lies at 2,260 feet in the Sequoia National Forest, while towering above the rivers on the north side of the canyon is Spanish Peak, which is 10,051 feet tall. This canyon is arguably the deepest canyon in North America for a short distance.  \r\n\r\nThe North Fork Kings River starts in the John Muir Wilderness of the Sierra National Forest and flows in a westerly direction. It is impounded at Wishon Reservoir and then flows in a southerly direction through Blackrock Reservoir and eventually meets the other two forks just east of Pine Flat Reservoir.  \r\n\r\nThe Middle and South Forks are both designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers from shortly below their confluence to their headwaters.  This designation took place on November 3, 1987.  \r\n\r\nThe Middle Fork Kings River starts in the northern part of Kings Canyon National Park.  It flows through a beautiful glacially carved canyon known as Tehipite Valley before joining the South Fork near Yucca Point in the Sequoia National Forest.\r\n\r\nThe South Fork Kings River also flows through a glacially carved canyon and this stretch is known as the Kings Canyon.  I think a no more beautiful descriptive overview exists for Kings Canyon other than John Muir's so I've decided to include it here.  \r\n\r\nA Rival of the Yosemite\r\nThe Ca\u00f1on of the South Fork of Kings River, California\r\nby John Muir, 1891\r\n\r\n\"In the vast Sierra wilderness far to the southward of the famous Yosemite Valley, there is a yet grander valley of the same kind. It is situated on the south fork of King's River, above the most extensive groves and forests of the giant sequoia, and beneath the shadows the highest mountains in the range, where the ca\u00f1ons are deepest and the snow-laden peaks are crowded most closely together. It is called the Big King's River Ca\u00f1on, or King's River Yosemite, and is reached by way of Visalia, the nearest point on the Southern Pacific Railroad, from which the distance is about forty-five miles, or by the Kearsarge Pass from the east side of the range. It is about ten miles long, half a mile wide, and the stupendous rocks of purplish gray granite that form the walls are from 2500 to 5000 feet in height, while the depth of the valley beloved the general surface of the mountain mass from which it has been carved is considerably more than a mile. Thus it appears that this new Yosemite is longer and deeper, and lies embedded in grander mountains, than the well-known Yosemite of the Merced. Their general characters, however are wonderfully alike, and they bear the same relationship to the fountains of the ancient glaciers above them. \r\n\r\n\"As to waterfalls, those of the new valley are far less striking in general views, although the volume of falling water is nearly twice as great and comes from higher sources. The descent of the King's River streams is mostly made in the form of cascades, which are outspread in flat plume-like sheets on smooth slopes, or are squeezed in narrow-throated gorges, boiling, seething, in deep swirling pools, pouring from lin to lin, and breaking into ragged, tossing masses of spray and foam in boulder-choked ca\u00f1ons,--making marvelous mixtures with the downpouring sunbeams, displaying a thousand and colors, and giving forth a great variety of wild mountain melody, which, rolling from side to side against the echoing cliffs, is at length all combined into one smooth, massy sea-like roar. \r\n\r\n\"The bottom of the valley is about 5000 feet above the sea, and its level or gently sloping surface is diversified with flowery meadows and groves and open sunny flats, through the midst of which the crystal river, ever changing, ever beautiful, makes it way; now gliding softly with scarce a ripple over beds of brown pebbles, now rustling and leaping in wild exultation across avalanche rock-dams or terminal moraines, swaying from side to side, beaten with sunshine, or embowered with leaning pines and firs, alders, willows, and tall balsam poplars, which with the bushes and grass at their feet make charming banks. Gnarled snags and stumps here and there reach out from the banks making cover for trout which seem to have caught their colors from rainbow spray, though hiding mostly in shadows, where the current swirls slowly and protecting sedges and willows dip their leaves. \r\n\r\n\"From this long, flowery, forested, well-watered park the walls rise abruptly in plain precipices or richly sculptured masses partly separated by side ca\u00f1ons baring wonderful wealth and variety of architectural forms, which are as wonderful in beauty of color and fineness of finish as in colossal height and mass The So-called war of the elements has done them no harm. There is no unsightly defacement as yet; deep in the sky, inviting the onset of storms through unnumbered centuries, they still stand firm and seemingly as fresh and unworn as new-born flowers. \r\n\r\n\"From the brink of the walls on either side the ground still rises in a series of ice-carved ridges and basins, superbly forested and adorned with many small lakes and meadows where deer and bear find grateful homes; while from the head of the valley mountains other mountains rise beyond in glorious array, every one of them shining with rock crystals and snow, and with a network of streams that sing their way down from lake to lake through a labyrinth of ice-burnished ca\u00f1ons. The area of the basins drained by the streams entering the valley is about 450 square miles, and the elevation of the rim of the general basin is from 9000 to upward of 14,000 feet above the sea; while the general basin of the Merced Yosemite has an area of 250 square miles, and its elevation is much lower. \r\n\r\n\"When from some commanding summit we view the mighty wilderness about this central valley, and, after tracing its tributary streams, note how every converging ca\u00f1on shows in its sculpture, moraines, and shining surfaces that it was once the channel of a glacier, contemplating this dark period of grinding ice, it would seem that here was a center of storm and stress to which no life would come. But it is just where the ancient glaciers bore down on the mountain flank with crushing and destructive and most concentrated energy that the most impressive displays of divine beauty are offered to our admiration. Even now the snow falls every winter about the valley to a depth of ten to twenty feet, and the booming of avalanches is a common sound. Nevertheless the frailest flowers, blue and gold and purple, bloom on the brows of the great ca\u00f1on rocks, and on the frosty peaks, up to a height of 13,000 feet, as well as in sheltered hollows and on level, meadows and lake borders and banks of streams.\"\r\n\r\nTo read more of this John Muir article, click here.\r\n\r\n Kings Canyon Panorama as photographed in October 2006 from Hwy 180 in the Sequoia National Forest\r\n ", "Created/Edited": "Sep6,2006/Jan4,2007", "Giant Sequoia Groves": "Like big trees?

Spots which required me to pull myself up with my upper body but nothing that was too extremely difficult if your are used to scrambling.  But please use your best judgement.  There is even a cave on this particular portion that could probably be explored if you feel like squeezing into it as it opens up, but I do mean SQUEEZE.  Again, please use good judgement.

In the late 1800s, the gullies caused by erosion and water run-off were recorded to be approximately five feet deep. That process has continued to this day, with some of the deepest gullies in the canyon now over 150 deep.\r\n\r\nAt the visitor's center, there is a small field museum on the geology of the area, as well as a short (~13 minute) video discussing the history and formation of the canyon.\r\n\r\nAlso from the visitors center, there are two trails that can be taken in the park.

Look for a small climber's trail up the steep slope among the trees. Follow this trail to the start of large boulder/talus section. This part of approach is unpleasant.Approach Cracked Canyon by parking in roadside pullouts directly below the canyon. A rough access trail walks up through the forest and onto the steep talus slope below the canyon. Take care not to tumble unstable talus onto those below. More loose talus fills the steeple angled canyon floor. Again, use caution not to avalanche boulders down.\u00a0Allow 15 to 20 min to the entry of the canyon, add at least 10 to 15 more if planning to go all the way to the top.

It is basically connected with Ophir Wall and offers a great quality climbing, mostly traditional style with a few bolted lines, which require additional gear placement. The descent is via rappel from slings around trees or fixed rap anchors. The routes range in difficulty from 5.4 to 5.13, with an emphasis of 5.7 to 5.10 range. The style are some easier slabs to fierce overhanging cracks. Hard rhyolite makes holds and cracks very solid. There are almost 100 routes within this deep cliff lined canyon. It is one of the most popular destinations at Ophir.\u00a0\nThe climbing is at fairly high elevation, so summer storm can move in very fast. The approach involves an unpleasant scramble on large boulders, but the rock and the quality of climbing here make up for it.\u00a0\nThe orientation of the canyon makes it possible to find shade at any time of the day, and it is well protected from the wind.\u00a0Some say that western slope of Colorado has a really bad rock, but there are several noteworthy crags with top notch climbing that rivals Colorado finest, and Cracked Canyon is one of those examples.\u00a0Cracked Canyon is home to many fine single pitch outings, and the nearby Ophir Wall with climbs up to 900 feet tall can extend heights. The surrounding scenery is stunning, and the nearby Telluride offers great cuisine and entertainment.\u00a0\n", "History of Climbing at Ophir/Cracked Canyon": "\nCracked Canyon - climber on Javelin 5.11. Royal Robbins climbed the first ascent in mountain boots!\nThe San Juan Mountaineers did some rock climbing in the Telluride area in the 1930s as they explored the nearby craggy peaks in the Wilson group (Wilson Peak, Mount Wilson and El Diente) near Lizard Head Pass. The Ophir Wall was first climbed, probably in the 1950s or early 1960s, via the so called Post Office Crack, directly behind the tiny post office.\u00a0In 1969, David Farney closed his Ashcrofters school in Aspen and moved operations to the Skyline Ranch near Telluride. One of his guides was Henry Barber of Boston, who began explorations of the Ophir Wall, partnering with Greg Davis. Barber made first ascent of some superb Ophir Wall lines, including the top to bottom dihedral system Hot Wee Wee.\u00a0in 1973, Bill Kees, the original Ophir Wall Bum and the goodfather of Telluride climbing, added classic routes such as Orange Peel, with Jack Koffman. This one pitch, 5.10 crack was hidden away in what would be known as Cracked Canyon.\u00a0In 1977 some strange news hit town, Royal Robbins moving to Telluride? As the Bumbs sat on barstools in the evenings and on porches of old Ophir cabins,images of rocks climbs flashed before their eyes. They knew the Californians would soon be exploring their crags, and they resolved to really get after it.\u00a0In the summer of 1978, Chris Vandiver joined Robbins in Telluride and the Rockcraft climbing school opened for business. That year, the total Telluride route count doubled. Especially popular were the short, steep cracks of Cracked Canyon, where many excellent routes were climbed, mostly by the Californians. Particularly painful for the Ophir Wall Bums was the first ascent of Javelin, the best looking crack in the Cracked Canyon. Strenuous, overhanging, and attempted on several occasions before the California invasion, it was led with an easy by Vandiver, and then by Royal Robbins.\u00a0The demand for climbing instruction in Telluride was limited and the Rockcraft school would last but a few years. Kees and others had much better success putting Telluride on the international climbing map by putting together Mountain Film in 1979. The first film festival on continent devoted solely to mountaineering.\u00a0In the summer of 1980, quite a collection of name climbers was gathered in this funky mountain town in the San Juans. Among them were the young California couple John Long and Lynn Hill. Lynn made the first ascent of Ophir Broke, solid 5.12, which was in that time the hardest crack climb in Colorado and even Yosemite had only a climb or two that were harder.\u00a0\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=37.85600&amp;distance_lon_9=-107.83120&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.85600\u00b0N/107.8312\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "Jun17,2013/Jan31,2014", "Season": "Summer,Fall", "Routes": "Rock Type: RhyoliteHeight: 60 to 150 feet, most around 80 feet longClimbing Style: traditional with some bolts here and thereGear Suggestion: full rack with some large cams (there are several off width cracks)Descent: rappel, mostly from fixed anchors or slings around treesLand Status: USFS\n\nChewbacca 5.8+Exodus 5.8Genesis 5.4Orange Peel 5.10Beginner's Luck 5.6DescentOn top of the wallsRappel Anchors", "Red Tape": "\nTelluride Rocks guidebook\u00a0\nThere are no fees.

I want to reiterate this is an emergency exit to be used only if:\n1. You are in the path of a flash flood,\n2. You find that your gear is not suitable for doing even the bypass route\n3. You find that you are new to rappelling and technical canyoneering and you don't want to rappel anymore\n4. Someone gets injured and cannot rappel anymore (although if someone is injured this escape route isn't easy by any means)\nThis route is mostly class 3 with one class 4 move that has exposure.\u00a0Follow the joint in the rocks up the left side of the canyon looking down canyon from the prescribed place in the Part 2 section. You will quickly notice two side canyons emerge and a small ridge between them. When you get  about 100 feet above Quandary Canyon and 125 meters horizontal, there will be a fork in the ridge. If you take the right fork there is a dry-fall that cannot be up-climbed. Take the left fork around a head of rock to a point where there is a class 4 climbing move with about 30 feet of exposure below.If you want you can have the most experienced climber climb up this and set up an anchor on a small arch in the rock at the top to belay others up. Shortly after that is a small slot about 100 feet long that must be chimneyed or bridged over to get around the evil bushes that are growing inside. Once at the upper end of this little slot, the most technical work is over. Locate a long, steep talus slope that veers to the right and start climbing it.

At this notch you are standing at the very head of the Quandary Canyon drainage.\u00a0Descend into the very upper reaches of Quandary canyon and follow the dry wash for a short distance. After about 200 meters in this dry wash you will notice a steep talus slope going up to your right with two very large rocks at the top. This is where you have to make your first decision to climb up to the top of the cliffs through the Knotted Rope Crack or continue down canyon.", "Quandary Canyon Part 2": "Once you pass the natural bridge, continue down canyon. The canyon is easy at first and works its way through large piles of rocks and small dryfalls.\nQuandary Canyon\nWhen you get to your first dry-fall that cannot be climbed down, backtrack about 50 feet and climb up and out of the canyon on the right side looking down canyon. You can then descend back into the canyon below the dry-fall. A large cottonwood tree and a pothole of water are at the bottom.\u00a0You will then pass through a short section of easy walking before coming to a pothole that is a short jump into and walk through/climb out or a very short wade.\nEasy walking section\nThis poses no problem. Right after that small pothole is a 10 meter dry-fall with a rappel anchor high above on the left side looking down canyon.\u00a0Climb up the slick-rock and anchor yourself in. Because the anchor is 5 more meters above the top of the dry-fall, it is a 15 meter rappel and a 30 meter rope is needed for this rappel. Once at the bottom, walk through the sandy pothole around the corner to the right and climb out. If this is filled with water it is a 25 yard swim or wade. It was empty in March 2011.\nRappel 3 in Quandary Canyon, Photo by Scott\nYou will then pass through an area with nice slick-rock and many small potholes. The canyon then turns slightly right TO FOLLOW A JOINT in the rock for about 25 yards and then comes to a narrow chute leading down to a pothole. If you look to the left up the joint you will see what appears to be a route out heading up and to the northeast. DO NOT climb out this way unless you absolutely have to. I'll explain this route later in the section called \"Emergency Exit\" Instead, there are two ways to get down the narrow chute. You could backtrack about 30 feet and climb up and out of the canyon on the right side looking down canyon. Walk around on this bench above the pothole and look for a small arch to set up an anchor for a 50 foot rappel back down into the canyon below the pothole. There are not very many places to set up an anchor on this bench and any slings currently there I would test. You could also DC the chute if you are a good canyoneer. If you choose to DC it, it might be a bit of work to get out of the pothole from inside it.EDIT: As of early 2013 the chute I describe above is no longer there. Apparently floods have filled it in. Thanks to Scott for this information.\nSection that follows the joint - Note the log\nBelow this the canyon narrows a lot and passes by many smaller potholes that may require wading or short swims. Squeeze your way through a narrow and tilted section of the canyon until you reach a small open area with an easy section. Just past this easy section the canyon makes a SHARP right turn at coordinates N-38 degrees 33 minutes 14 seconds and W-110 degrees 55 minutes 34 seconds and leads to a small pothole and a big drop. \nWorking through the narrows, Photo by Scott", "Getting There": "The canyon starts near the historic Hidden Splendor Mine at the southern end of the San Rafael Swell. To get there, stop at the small town of Green River, Utah and make sure your gas tank is full. From there drive west on I-70 about 29 miles and take exit number 131. Turn left off the offramp (or right if coming FROM the west), and continue on the very high quality frontage road that parallels the freeway for a short distance then turns south. Follow this very good dirt road for 10 miles to a junction. All the junctions are well signed in this part of the swell and all the roads needed to get to Hidden Splendor are good. At the first junction, veer right and go another 4 miles to another junction in which you will turn right. If you follow the signs for Hidden Splendor, you can't mess up!\u00a0Go 1 mile and take a left at the road leading towards Hidden Splendor Mine and McKay Flat (heading right at this junction will take you down Reds Canyon).\u00a0Now go 8 miles and take another left onto the road going down to Hidden Splendor Mine. This road is 10 miles long and ends at the mine in the middle of nowhere.

However it's very unlikely you will see any aircraft during your visit.\n\nSunset seen from Hidden Splendor\n\nSunset seen from Hidden Splendor\nTo get to the start of Quandary Canyon, go back up the Hidden Splendor road 3 miles to a 4X4 track that heads south towards the reef. If you are in a low clearance vehicle simply park on the side of the road here and walk the 4 wheel drive road. It is only 3/4 mile long otherwise if you have high clearance you can drive to its end at the old 1950, blue Ford car that has been sitting there riddled with bullet holes for who knows how long!\u00a0Where this old car sits is where the hike officially starts.

It can bypass the first part of Quandary Canyon if you want. It's much prettier and worth the extra time. If your goal is to just descend the canyon, maybe disregard this variation.\u00a0From the talus slope mentioned above, veer out of the dry wash and start climbing. The slope goes up about 400 feet where many rocks are loose so be careful not to jar any loose on your friends below! As you near the top you will come across two or three very large rocks that seem to block the way. Go around these to the left and you will see a crack underneath them. Work your way through this crack with some class 3 scrambling and emerge at the top.From here, walk due east working your way towards the top of the cliffs you saw above you at the Hidden Splendor Mine and prepare yourself for one of the best views in southern Utah.\u00a0When you get to the cliffs you could simply sit and relax for a bit taking in the views. A sea of red rocks and little canyons in an area known as the Keesle Country sits below you. The San Rafael Reef fills the horizon as it wraps around to the north making a circle. I have done my best to capture this place with photographs but they still don't do justice. \nView from the top of the reef\n\nIf you want to see the old mine sheds and long cable, wander your way further east along the cliffs for about a mile towards the upper end of Knotted Rope Canyon (the canyon just east of Quandary). I do not recommend looking for these mine ruins if you still plan to go down Quandary. Once you get to your first overlook it is recommended you continue on your hike. You don't want to run out of daylight in Quandary Canyon as you will also have your return hike to do. If however you wish to spend your day on the top of these cliffs and return the way you came up and save Quandary for another day then do so; I could easily live up there.\u00a0Once you are satisfied with your views, you can retrace your steps back down the slope you climbed back into the dry wash and continue down canyon from there. If you go this route you will not miss any part of the canyon itself. This upper part of Quandary will have two short 12 foot rappels that have easy natural anchors to use before getting to the large open area.\nLooking into Upper Quandry Canyon from the first 12 foot rappel\n\nThe first 12 foot rappel, Photo by Scott\n\nThe second 12 foot rappel, Photo by Scott\nHowever if you want to test your route finding skills, start heading south from the top of the cliffs and hike along the east rim of a large side canyon. Ignore any cairns you see and don't drop down into this side canyon. Go maybe a half mile south until you see a second side canyon that is a large bowl. You will see it drains into a large open area. This is the open area you want to get to. Route find and down climb into the upper bench of this bowl. You will then have to walk all the way around the bowl to an easy spot to descend into the open area.\nThe bowl to descend into and walk around\nThis route took us awhile. If you are concerned about time, it's better to go back down the Knotted Rope Crack and quickly rappel the two short dry-falls and get to the open area that way.\u00a0Note that the old mining road went down this part of the canyon to get to the large open area below. Since then, floods have reamed out these two dry-falls.", "Quandary Canyon Part 4 and Return Route": "Once back in the main canyon, continue down-canyon where it makes nearly a complete U turn to the left and continue past some more minor obstacles.\u00a0At the Navajo/Carmel contact you will see a trail that follows a wide ledge above the canyon bottom on the east side that takes you above and around a large drop. Take this trail and follow it down the ledges until it brings you to a couple ramps and finally into a thicket of cottonwoods and grasses.\nSunrise on Quandary Canyon from the high ledges\nThat last photo was taken from a point way above the previously mentioned trail on the rim of the deep gorge that is Quandary Canyon. You could take a short side hike up the rim if you want for some spectacular views.\u00a0Otherwise, whack your way through the bushes and emerge into a large dry wash at the base of the San Rafael Reef.\nView of the reef from the mouth of Quandary Canyon\nFrom there turn left (east) and hike the dry wash for 1.5 miles as it weaves its way through the steeply dipping beds of Carmel, Morrison and Entrada formations. After 1.5 miles you will come across a dry-fall that you climb over on the left side. After another half mile you will come to the junction of the Ramp Canyon drainage marked by a cairn. You'll also notice the deep gorge cutting through the San Rafael Reef that is Ramp Canyon before you actually get to the junction. Turn left into this wash and hike up Ramp Canyon. \nEntering Ramp Canyon\nRoute Details for Ramp Canyon can be found in my \"Ramp Canyon, Cistern Canyon and the Muddy River Gorge\" page.\u00a0You could also turn right at the bottom of Quandary Canyon and follow the dry wash until it intersects the Muddy River and then hike of the Muddy River Gorge just to hike 3 miles of the Hidden Splendor Road back to your car if you want. This route is much much longer though.\nHiking through the Muddy River Gorge\n\nSan Rafael Reef panorama from the bottom end of the Muddy River Gorge\n\nSan Rafael Reef panorama from the bottom end of the Muddy River Gorge", "History": "This area was one of the richest Uranium mines back in the days of the Utah Mining boom in the 1950's. This was a time when Uranium was in high demand due to World War II and Miners did some pretty incredible things at Hidden Splendor to try to get it. One on the most notable was the road they constructed and blasted out of the reef that started where the old Ford sits and went up and over the reef into upper Quandary Canyon. Many other roads were plowed out of the steep talus all around the backside of the reef. Miners also had drilling equipment helicoptered up to the to of the reef which included thousands of feet of metal pipe to pump water up from Muddy River. A small mining shed with a large wood stove is along with drill hole remains are found at the upper end of both Quandary Canyon and Miners Hollow. As you work your way through Quandary Canyon, you will hike on this old road, see remnants of blasting and pass a drill hole with old mining equipment. If you continue west towards Miners Hollow, you will come across a long pipeline that at one point pumped water 1,400 feet up from the river below.\nSome people get very angry when they see mining remnants in a beautiful place like this however I see it as an interesting side trip where I take myself back in time and wonder what it was like during those days. Being a geologist myself I kind of enjoy seeing these things in such remote places. It puts things into perspective to realize that these areas are only very recently used for recreation. Not too long ago no one ever came to these parts and the ones who did were there for long periods of time living in hardship in the mines or as outlaws. Now we go to these areas only a few days at a time for fun. A lot has changed in a very short period of time.The Hidden Splendor closed in the late 50's when the US government quit subsidizing the Uranium boom and most of the mines in the area closed with most of the equipment deserted. Another big mine in the San Rafael Swell was the Temple Mountain mine at at Temple Junction there was once a small town with a saloon and a post office.

Cistern canyon is a simple walk through and isn't too spectacular but provides different scenery and a good second half of a great loop hike. It is recommended that one travels up Ramp canyon and down Cistern Canyon due to the climbing needed in Ramp Canyon that would be much easier going up.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalkstone at bottom of Cistern Canyon can easily be walked under", "Created/Edited": "Jan5,2011/Mar2,2013", "Getting There - Ramp and Cistern Canyon Loop": "This loop incorporates Ramp and Cistern Canyons and takes you on the Wild Horse Road all the way until it gets to the Muddy River crossing past the trailheads for Little Wild Horse Canyon and Ding/Dang Canyons.

For Ramp and Cistern park at the river and start hiking upstream in a westward direction on the north side of the river whacking your way through the grasses and bushes. After a short distance you will notice the river pinches out at a cliff and you will have to wade through the river twice to get by.\nWading the Muddy River to get around the cliff\nWhen I did this loop it was over Thanksgiving in 2009 and the water was very cold.\u00a0Continue upstream by heading due west. Avoid all the switchbacks the river makes and head more in a straight line to shorten the mileage. After about 1.5 miles you will notice another large stream (may be dry in summer and fall) draining into the Muddy River from the south. This is Salt Wash and is the topic for another page. At this stream junction you will also notice you enter a very large valley between the San Rafael Reef directly ahead and a series of Entrada and bentonite hills and cliffs to your right. It's here that you will turn right and follow the valley in a northeastward direction. A small stream bed makes for a nice route as you walk up this beautiful valley.The San Rafael Swell seen near the strike valleyThe San Rafael Swell from the strike valley at sunsetAfter another 1.5 miles along the valley you will come across a green patch of grasses to your left. This is the mouth of Quandary Canyon. A number of side trips can be done if you head up this drainage but the canyon itself is very difficult and requires technical gear and can only be descended.\u00a0However one could work their way up this drainage and start heading steeply up the right rim of Quandary Canyon and get high for some nice views as I did. There is a very nice camp spot in the middle of this grassy area next to a small cottonwood tree. This is where we camped.Sunrise on the Navajo cliffs of Quandary Canyon taken from the opposite rimContinue past the mouth of Quandary for another 2 miles.

The property on which the canyon is located was owned by a rancher named Waldo Wilcox and had been in the Wilcox family since 1951.  He had kept the historical treasures on his property a secret in the hopes of protecting them from damage and looting and was quite successful in this endeavor.  In 2001, however, he decided that it was time to sell his beautiful and secluded ranch.  The sale was made to the non-profit Trust for Public Land, who in turn transferred the land to the State of Utah.  The State placed control of the site under the Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) and quietly began archeological research on the site.  Since then DWR has been tightly controlling access to the canyon to preserve the integrity of the archeological sites.  Today, the stewardship of this fantastic site is being transferred again, this time to the University of Utah.  Many people are now patiently waiting to find out what this new change means.

There is an old dirt road that runs the full length of it that served as access when the canyon was a working ranch.  It\u2019s used today by scientists and management officials to facilitate their work and by hikers as the primary trail through the area.  The canyon is beautiful and very much a worthwhile hike even without the archeological component.  The ancient artifacts in the area are not dramatic or highly visible like what you would see in Mesa Verde N.P. or Chaco N.H.P.  They consist of pictographs and petroglyphs, remnants of pithouses, granaries high on the cliff walls, pottery shards and other implements.  Looking for these different things feels somewhat like a treasure hunt.  There are no interpretive signs or markers so you have to be a bit of an archeologist yourself.  It should go without saying, but when you come across artifacts, don't disturb them.  Take only photos with you when you leave.  Native American artifacts aren\u2019t the only things you will find in the canyon.  The area is rich in wildlife and you may come across anything from bighorn sheep to foxes.  This is bear country, so when you\u2019re there take the normal precautions you would anywhere there are black bears present.  There\u2019s a small herd of wild bison in the bookcliff region that encompasses Range Creek.  The bison aren\u2019t in the canyon today, but who knows; sometime in the future they may also be part of the experience.  There are also mountain lions in the area.  In fact, Waldo Wilcox, the former owner of Range Creek Canyon, used to trap them and sell them to zoos many years ago to supplement his income.  The hike through the area is a little over 14 miles, one direction.  The only water in the area comes from Range Creek.  It\u2019s a cool, clear stream but needs to be filtered or treated before you drink it.  Even though this is a desert environment, the north end of the canyon is wooded and the transition in vegetation as you hike through is very pleasant and interesting.

Travel is restricted to foot and horseback, though several specific groups and agencies have the authority to operate vehicles in the canyon  and you may encounter them in there.

After you purchase the permit, you must register for the days your wish to enter the canyon and may make reservations for up to five consecutive days.  This is done over the internet at this website.

In its German translation it is called Helms Klamm and ever since I read the book for the first time some 30 years ago, it has been associated in my mind with one of the narrow gorges (or slot canyons) we have in the Alps. At first I connected Helm's Deep with Breitachklamm in the Allg\u00e4u Alps but ever since the summer of 2006 another beautiful gorge took its place: Gilfenklamm in the east of the Botzer Group of the southern Stubai Alps.\r\n\r\nThe area is made up from all kinds of different types of rock thanks to its proximity to the Peradriatic Fault, the faultline which separates the European tectonic plate from the North African one. During the creation of the Alps mountains were piled up, then overthrown by earthquakes only to be piled up again. Consequently rocks of all ages lie close to each other and the Botzer Group is known for its abundance in ore-rich rocks. Close to the place described on this page there is a huge mining area, where the mines traverse the whole mountain range at an elevation of nearly 3000m, the highest mines of the Alps. In other places, mainly to the east of the group, different kinds of limestone prevail: proper limestone, dolomite and marble.And through this latter material the Ratschingsbach Creek cut a deep narrow gorge: Gilfenklamm\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nGilfenklamm or Kaiser Franz Josef Klamm, in Italian Gola dell'Imperatore Francesco Giuseppe is the only such canyon worldwide, carved out of white marble. Its length is approximately 5km and more than 100 years ago in 1898 a path has been established through the whole length. A multitude of bridges lead back and forth across the canyon and railings secure the path, which sometimes clings to the sheer rock. The first visitor was the Austrian Emperor Franz-Josef, who for quite a while served as naming patron to the canyon. However, after the fall of the Austrian Empire and after the area had to be turned over to the Italians its original name came back in use.\r\n\r\nIf you expect to be blinded by white marble, you will be disappointed, however. Erosion and omnipresent moss and other plants darken the rock to a brownish green. The only white places are where you can see the creek foaming underneath. Seeing the creek, however, can be a difficult undertaking. The canyon is so narrow and deep that a deep roar often is the only sign that water is flowing underneath. There are numerous waterfalls and in some places the creek has carved out caves. Above, the walls can be as high as 200m and more often than not the sky is hidden from view.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe force of the water is omnipresent inside the canyon. The aforementioned deep roar is accompanied by a thin cloud of spray wherever you go. The water shoots through at an incredible speed and violence. During the snow-melt the gorge becomes unpassable and many an uprooted tree can be found at the lower entrance, shredded to pieces by the aquatic force. Maintaining the trail under these conditions is tough and expensive and requires the locals to request an entrance fee of a few Euro (2\u20ac in 2006). It is money well spent though you should make sure to be early as in the afternoon hours whole busloads of tourists are shipped to the canyon.

From the State Park Website:\r\n\r\nSecluded Goblin Valley was first discovered by cowboys searching for cattle. Then, in the late 1920's, Arthur Chaffin, owner/operator of the Hite Ferry on the Colorado River, and two companions were searching for an alternate route between Green River and Cainsville. They came to a vantage point about a mile west of Goblin Valley and were awed by what they saw - five buttes and a valley of strange-shaped rock formations surrounded by a wall of eroded cliffs. \r\n\r\nIn 1949, Chaffin returned to the area he called Mushroom Valley. He spent several days exploring the mysterious valley and photographing its scores of intricately eroded goblins. Publicity attracted visitors to the valley despite its remoteness. In 1954, it was proposed that Goblin Valley be protected from vandalism. The state of Utah later acquired the property and established Goblin Valley State Reserve. It was officially designated a sate park on August 24, 1964. \r\n\r\nIf you are in the area, plan on at least a day to explore the area.

It extends southward to Lees Ferry in Arizona where the Colorado River flows through Marble Canyon and on toward the Grand Canyon.  Glen Canyon National Recreation Area encompasses this area.  It is managed by the National Park Service and stretches over 1.2 million acres.  To the west are Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and Capitol Reef National Park.  To the east and north are the Navajo Reservation, the BLM land of Cedar Mesa and Dark Canyon, and Canyonlands National Park.  The Recreation Area is anchored by the Glen Canyon Dam which was started in 1956 and finished in 1963 but it took many years for the Colorado, San Juan, Escalante, and Dirty Devil Rivers and their tributaries to fill Lake Powell behind it.  In 1980 the lake was considered to be at full capacity, but in recent years drought has made it so the level of Lake Powell has dropped making some areas that were once under water accessible for hikers and canyoneers once again.  Some believe that Lake Powell should be permanently drained and the area restored.  \r\n\r\nLake Powell was named after Major John Wesley Powell, the first white man to explore its length.  He went on to explore the Grand Canyon as well.  I highly recommend reading his book, The Exploration of the Colorado River and its Canyons.  In it he named Glen Canyon.  He described, \"...wonderful features -- carved walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches, mounds and monuments. From which of these features shall we select a name?

Here are some of the finer points...\r\n\r\nObtain Maps & Current Information\r\nHiking here is generally on unmarked routes. Obtain current hiking information and topographic maps prior to your trip. When possible, stay on established routes. Let someone at home know your plans and when you expect to be back. \r\n\r\nKnow Who to Contact in an Emergency  \r\nKeep in mind that cell phones do not work in many parts of the canyon, so don\u2019t count on them. Bring a signal mirror as a backup communication device. \r\n\r\nDrink Plenty of Water  \r\nDrink a minimum of 1 gallon of water per person per day. Filter or treat all water. \r\n\r\nKnow Where You Are  \r\nHiking in Glen Canyon and its tributaries often requires walking in water and beating a path through thick vegetation. Side canyons are easily missed. Stay oriented to your location by using a topographic map. \r\n\r\nBeware of Hypothermia \r\nMany canyons have deep pools that require wading or swimming. Wet conditions may cause hypothermia even during hot weather. Carry dry clothing. \r\n\r\nQuicksand is common here \r\nAlthough few pockets are more than waist-deep (most are less than knee-deep), it\u2019s best to avoid it. If you do step in quicksand, don\u2019t panic! \r\n\r\nBe Prepared for Poor Road Conditions  \r\nStorms can leave dirt roads impassable for several days. Leave extra food and water in your vehicle. \r\n\r\nFlash Floods  \r\nFlash floods can occur at any time of year, but they are most common in July, August, and September. Checking the local weather forecast is advisable, but you should realize that conditions change quickly, and it is impossible to predict where heavy rain will occur. Avoid narrow canyons and washes during stormy weather. Be aware of changing weather conditions. Know your escape routes. If you\u2019re hiking in a stream, be aware of rising water levels or stronger currents and sudden changes in water clarity. Educate yourself on the terrain you are entering. Realize that dry washes are a result of previous flash floods. \r\n\r\nBy entering a narrow canyon or wash, you are assuming a risk.\r\n\r\nIf flooding begins, seek high ground and wait for the water to go down before attempting to walk out. Do not enter a narrow canyon if storms threaten. Never camp in a wash bottom. \r\n\r\nCreepy Crawlies and Other Things \r\nEducating yourself about the hazards associated with snakes, insects, and poisonous plants in the desert is essential. \r\n\r\nDeer flies and gnats come out in the early summer months. In wet areas, wear long pants and long sleeve shirts to avoid fly bites. \r\n\r\nPoison ivy grows here near water sources.

A fall in this section might hurt, so you might want to use some sort of protection. After this portion, the canyon becomes gentler. There are a few other brief falls, but these are minimal compared to the other falls.The only real obstacle is the overgrowth trees and bushes.\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0", "Location": "California,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

{"Activities": "Hiking,Bouldering,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "To get to Red Breaks go to the town of Escalante Utah which is situated on Highway 12. Five miles east of Escalante off of Highway 12 is a right turn on the famous Hole-in-the-Rock Road. If one drives all the way to the road end nearly 60 miles to the southeast it will take you to the famous \"break\" in the cliffs above the Colorado River which allowed for Mormon pioneers to be able to descend the cliffs with their wagons down to the river for water and a nice place to settle. This \"break\" in the cliffs is known as the Hole-in-the-Rock for obvious reasons and the current dirt road follows the same route taken by the pioneers. This road is usually in good condition for the first 45 miles although may be really wash-boarded later in the summer. Any passenger car can usually drive this road to the 45 mile mark where high clearance vehicles become needed. The most dangerous part of the road are some of the cattle guards that some lower clearance vehicles may bottom out on so the one thing I advise is to never drive fast over any cattle guard.\u00a0The starting point for Red Breaks is the trailhead for Harris Wash. To get here take the Hole-in-the-Rock road southeast for 11 miles until you see the Harris Wash trailhead sign on the left. Take this side road to its end at Harris Wash; after 6 miles. Here are the coordinates for the official trailhead so you can use Google Earth to look around. Harris Wash drains east while Red Breaks comes in from the north.\n\n37 degrees 38.076 minutes North\n111 degrees 20.423 minutes West\n\nIn March 2010 our passenger car (Subaru) was able to make it when driven carefully all the way to the end of this road but a HCV will be needed to cross Harris Wash and continue north. Crossing Harris Wash will not shorten your hike though and it's recommended you just start from the official Harris Wash trailhead marked by a sign and a small camping area.\u00a0Start by crossing Harris Wash. You can't miss it as it's the biggest stream bed around. Do NOT start walking up or down Harris Wash unless that's your intent (Red Breaks is much better). After crossing you will follow the road north for a short distance through a small grove of trees. Follow this road for 260 yards where you will see it cross a small sandy stream bed. This is the Red Breaks drainage and it's imperative you turn left and follow this stream bed upstream. If you stay in the stream bed, you can't get lost.\n\nLingering snow in the Red Breaks drainage\n\nContinue upstream and after about 1.75 miles the main fork begins to narrow up. You will have to bypass a small dryfall by walking up to the west rim a short way up. Just past the bypass, re-enter the canyon and it then rapidly becomes a very nice and photogenic slot that is a simple walk-through with a couple chalkstones to climb over. These may cause single parties grief but two or more people can easily help one another if needed.\nMain fork of Red Breaks slotMain fork curves\nSince the 2009-2010 winter had been so wet in Utah we ran into some water we had to wade/chimney over when we went in March but this slot is usually dry. The Main fork slot continues for about a half mile and comes out to a small opening. This is a good spot to take a short break as it is an important junction.\nMain Fork opens up...Climb out to the left here on the slabs and hike the rim\nThis opening is where a number of other forks branch off from the main fork.\u00a0Your ultimate goal is to ascend the Big West Fork of Red Breaks as this is the slot known to be the best walk through slot around (although the Main Fork was pretty superb too).\u00a0A large dryfall blocks entry to the Big West fork from the canyon bottom but at the opening of the Main fork shown in the above photo, climb up the left side of the canyon looking upstream (the area shown right in the middle of the photo) to the darker Carmel rim and continue up-canyon around a bend until you see the dryfall below you. Descend into the Big West fork above the dryfall and continue up-canyon. The Main fork continues to the right while the Big West fork heads off to the left above the dryfall. The coordinates of the opening in the main fork and the bypass route of the dryfall are:\n\n37 degrees 39.923 minutes North\n111 degrees 20.523 minutes West\n\nThe Big West fork quickly slots up and remains a beautiful slot canyon for another mile. Be there when the sun is high for some beautiful glowing canyon walls.\n\nBig West fork narrows \n\nBig West Fork Narrows\n\nThis canyon does not require any technical gear although there are nine (9) chalkstones that will have to be climbed over that some people will need a boost from another person to get over. Therefore it's important to go in pairs. When we went, I was able to climb over all but one of the chalkstones and my partner was able to climb over all but one as well. If you are pretty tall, you will may need some help on one of the stones where as if you're shorter, a different one will give you some problems. Note that some people will likely have trouble making it up some of these obstacles so it is best to go with some canyoneering experience and are comfortable with some exposure! The canyon opens up and offers many escape routes on the right hand side. Look for one and climb out the right side to the Carmel rim...enjoy the views as they are spectacular. For the return trip, you can either descend the Big West fork back to the Main fork back to your car. This would be recommended if you really enjoyed the slots you just went through. However if your a geology buff like me you may want to hike cross country on a sea of Navajo sandstone to see the Cosmic Ashtray. This is a large (about a football field in diameter) and deep (maybe 100 feet) hole in the ground among Navajo sandstone. There is also a rock island in the center. How this formed is completely unknown but I have my theories. Do not attempt to enter this large hole as the bottom is filled with deep sand and you will NOT be able to escape. Only enter if you are prepared with rappelling gear and ascenders and know how to use them. You don't want to get stuck down there forever.\n\nI'll try and preserve this geologic wonders' secrecy and spare everyone the details on how to get there but in a nutshell follow these steps to complete the loop. After ascending out of the Big west fork, generally head in an eastward direction and cross over 1 major drainage. This drainage is the upper west fork of Red Breaks. Climb out and continue east and enter a second major drainage which is called the Northeast fork of Red Breaks. Follow this fork upstream and round a high point to the right. We climbed this high point and I shot this panorama of the Red Breaks area.\n\nRed Breaks Panorama\nThis high point has coordinates:\n\n37 degrees 41.500 minutes North\n111 degrees 19.610 minutes West\n\nContinue around this point and weave through many round Navajo hills and cross two minor drainages. Generally head in a southeast direction and after about a mile from the high point you will reach the cosmic ashtray.\n\nThe Cosmic Ashtray\nIf you look closely you will see a person on the opposite rim of the cosmic ashtray in this photo.\u00a0After you have had you fill of eye-watering, chin-dropping glory of this wonder, look down the hill to the southeast and you will see a road.\u00a0This is the same road that crosses Harris Wash at the official trailhead so if you hike down to the road and turn RIGHT on it, you will return to Harris Wash and your car after 4.5 miles of walking on the road.\u00a0This loop is about 15 miles and makes for a superb day hike. Ideally it would take an entire day but it can be done in a half day if you want to rush things (not recommended). It is one of my all time favorite day hikes I have ever done and with that, I request that anyone who goes here to please keep the area wild and pristine. I plan to return here and want to see the area the same way I did when I went the first time. Don't make me regret making this page! I had a good heart and felt it would be nice to share this beautiful area for solitude seekers looking for adventure.Shown below is a map of the Red Breaks route I took with the main features labeled.\n", "Overview": "\n            Consider this page a gift. I wasn't initially going to make this page but then I figured this place wouldn't suffer too much if the visitation increases a little. This isn't your ordinary slot canyon. It's something much more. The loop hike that is described on this page is quite possibly one of the best day hikes I have ever done.\u00a0Red Breaks lies in the heart of the Grand Escalante National Monument and is known by locals to be one of the BEST non-technical slot canyons in all of the Colorado plateau...certainly the best non-technical slot in the Escalante River drainage basin. If you tell someone in the small town of Escalante that you plan to hit Red Breaks they will know you have done your homework.\n\nThe canyon walls of Red Breaks are composed of the traditional Navajo sandstone. Red Breaks is actually an elevated area where a part of the resistant Carmel formation that sits atop the Navajo sandstone hasn't completely eroded away. Surrounding Red Breaks is a sea of yellow-white Navajo sandstone that erodes into the distinctive round knobby hills.\u00a0This elevated \"platform\" measures about 5 miles long in the north-south direction and 2 miles wide in the east-west direction. Slicing down the center from north to south is the drainage for Red Breaks where a slot has formed and cut below the Carmel into the Navajo sandstone. There are 5 forks in the northern part of Red Breaks that all flow southward and converge at the Main Fork of Red Breaks. The main fork continues south and flows into Harris Wash which then flows into the Escalante River.\n\nWater rarely flows in these canyons especially since the drainage area is only about 10 square miles but when it does, mainly during summer storms, it really rushes downstream and gouges the slots ever deeper. Do not enter slot canyons if storms are in the forecast. Below is a strat column showing many of the rock units in southern Utah from the Permian to the Jurassic time periods. Notice the Navajo sandstone and the Carmel formation sits above the Wingate Sandstone that composes the walls of Little Death Hollow and Wolverine canyons.\n\nStrat column of the rock layers in southern Utah\nThe other secret about this area besides its remoteness is a geologic feature known by locals to be the \"Cosmic Ashtray\" Another name for this geologic wonder I have heard is the Quag Pit.

Consequently there are many ferry harbours and Crete is no exception. However, most of the smaller harbours only cater for transportation to the other islands while the major lines to the mainland are reserved to two harbours, Souda near Chania and Heraklion. Both serve connections to Peiraias and Thessaloniki.\r\n\r\nKritsa is a mountain village close to Agios Nilkolaos, the main tourist centre in the east of the island.

The best known ones, Samaria and Asfendou, are located to the south of the largest and second highest mountain range, the Levka Ori. However, gorges and canyons can be found in all of the limestone ranges of the island, deep and narrow cuts washed out by the scarce winter rains.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nOros Dikti, Crete's third highest range, also has its share of canyons, the most popular of which is located in its east.

Much of the gorge is hiking ground. The base is filled with gravel and only occasionally you have to avoid a boulder in its midst. In the central section, however, a step needs to be cleared and here the gorge narrows to the width of an armspan. Surfaces are smooth and there are only few small handholds. Protection is installed - a few short cabbles and a number of pins so that you can easily pass this part.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIn the upper part of the gorge a field of polished boulders bars the way.

Above this field the gorge widens into a valley which gradually rises up to an plateau in the east of the Dikti Range.

The gorge itself is short, less than 5km long, and seen from above shaped like an inverted \"S\". It can be reached on foot or by mountain bike and if you have some money to spare you can hire a jeep Taxi to be carried to the entrance of the gorge. From there on it is bouldering over smoothly polished and slippery limestone rocks into a place that rarely sees the light of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn its narrowest places Gola su Gorropu is only some 5 to 10m wide with 300m high walls! Naturally there is climbing in the gorge - there are supposed to be 3 routes ranging from 6b+ to 8b in difficulty and reaching up to 400m in length. I have been too busy to find my way on the gorge floor to think of looking for bolts and other climbing signs.\r\n\r\nThe best time to explore the gorge is the early morning - from the trailhead you have to walk quite a way to get to the entrance and the Flumineddu Valley is open to the sun, making it a very hot place indeed. I have been there in late May and don't want to imagine what it might be like in summer.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for starting early is the popularity of the gorge. Though far away from anything the jeep taxis carry a lot of people to the entrance and the narrow walls throw back echoes all over the place. In some places you'll be able to hear what is whispered 200m away and you can imagine the noise level that an Italian travel group creates. Be fast and go far - the last caverns of the \"inverted S\" are reached only by real climbers.\r\n\r\nAs stated above the limestone rocks are very smooth and - when wet - very slippery. Therefore in each location where there is grade II or III bouldering to be done fixed ropes are provided (four places in all). The trail is not marked - and though you might think that it is difficult to lose your way in a narrow gorge - it might still be difficult to find.

The park is located where the southernmost tip of the Sierra Nevada converge with the El Paso Range. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0The unique and colorful layers of white, pink, red, and brown cliffs grace both the east and west sides of Highway 14. These fluted folds are the result of wind and rain eroding the softer materials beneath the dark cap rocks, which were formed by a harder lava flow layer. \r\nThe colorful and scenic cliffs that comprise Red Rock Canyon State Park has been the location of many movies, videos and commercials, including Jurassic Park. In addition, the canyon is considered a wonderful classroom for the study of geology, paleontology and photography as well as an ideal place for family camping and exploration.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the area was once home to the Kawaiisu Indians, who left petroglyphs in the El Paso mountains and other evidence of their inhabitation. The spectacular gash situated at the western edge of the El Paso mountain range was on the Native American trade route for thousands of years. During the early 1870s, the colorful rock formations in the park served as landmarks for 20-mule team freight wagons that stopped for water. About 1850, it was used by the footsore survivors of the famous Death Valley trek including members of the Arcane and Bennett families along with some of the Illinois Jayhawkers. The park now protects significant paleontology sites and the remains of 1890s-era mining operations, and has been the site for a number of movies.\r\n\u00a0\r\nNatural History\r\nEach tributary canyon is unique, with vivid colors. Natural preserves have been set aside within the park to protect Red Rock's unique vegetation, wildlife and geology. After wet winters, the park's floral displays are stunning with Goldfields, Lupine, Indian Paintbrush, Sand Verbena and 200 other species. Joshua Trees, typical of the sandy, well-drained soils of the higher desert mingle with Cheesebrush, Bursage and Indian Tea. Lower desert Fishook Cactus, Desert Holly, Sagebrush and Saltbush also abound.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWildlife includes Roadrunners, hawks, lizards, mice and squirrels.

Once you reach the end, you\u2019re at the Redwood Saddle Trailhead.  ", "Hiking": "\u00a0A Walk Among Giants.There are 16 miles of trails in Redwood Canyon.  There is a loop around the canyon that is bisected by a second trail that extends as a spur an additional 2-\u00bc miles past the intersection with the loop.  Along the trails you\u2019ll see Barton\u2019s Post Camp (an old logging camp), Tunnel Tree (the trail actually goes through it), the Hart Tree (one of the larger Giant Sequoias in the park), Fallen Goliath and Big Spring.  You\u2019ll even see a hollowed out Giant Sequoia that was once used as a home \u2013 complete with rock chimneys!  \r\n\r\nThe area has been the subject of extensive study of the impact of forest fire on the Giant Sequoias.  You\u2019ll see evidence of fire damage and recovery from prescribed burns along some of the trails.  You\u2019ll want to stop at the occasional rock outcropping to just admire the beauty of the surrounding forest, and take special note of the density of Giant Sequoias (easily identified by their rounded tops when looking out over the forest).  But it is the close-up experience with these magnificent specimens that will stick with you.  The Giant Sequoias have an average height of 150-280 ft, and are 16-23 ft in diameter.  The bark of these trees is up to two feet thick.  And the oldest known trees are over 3,200 years old.  \r\n\r\nThis area is also populated with Sugar Pine trees.  You might wish to know that the typical Sugar Pine may be taller than the surrounding Giant Sequoias, and will have a larger pinecone (in fact, the largest of any tree in the world).  The sound of a 2-foot pinecone falling up to 250 feet is loud, long-lasting and memorable, to say the least!  Because of this, the forest will be alive with noise all day.  But at night the forest will become eerily quiet.  After the cacophony of the daytime it\u2019s almost surreal, and makes the experience of camping among these living giants all the more fascinating.\r\n\u00a0NPS Map of Trails in Redwood Canyon.\r\nSpecific hiking routes include:\r\n\r\nSugar Bowl Loop.  This 6.4-mile loop is sometimes referred to as the \"grove within a grove\".  It is particularly enjoyable because of the high density of young, Giant Sequoias.  Following the trailhead sign to the right, ascend a ridge of Redwood Mountain for 1.5 miles where a series of switchbacks lead to an overlook of Big Baldy.\u00a0Tunnel Tree.  Continue to the summit to another overlook at 2 miles.  The trail descends into the Sugar Bowl, a dense stand of mature and young Giant Sequoias.  After descending into the canyon you will encounter Redwood Creek and the junction to the Hart Tree.  Follow the trail to the left back to the parking area. \r\n\r\nHart Tree and Fallen Goliath Loop.  This 6.5-mile loop provides lots of vista points and a taste of the human history that are part of the Redwood Canyon experience.  Follow the old dirt road .3 miles to the trail sign.  Turn left and cross fern-lined Redwood Creek.  Barton's Post marks the remains of an old logging site from the 1800's.  The trail continues past lovely Hart Meadow and through the Tunnel Tree, a hollowed out Giant Sequoia.  At 3.2 miles you will reach a spur trail to the largest tree in the grove, the Hart Tree.  After passing a small waterfall, you will soon encounter Fallen Goliath.  \u00a0USGS Quadrangle topo extract.The trail will descend to the Redwood Canyon Trail, leading to Big Springs (another 3-mile spur) and to the junction with the Sugar Bowl Loop.  Veer right at both and continue up the canyon, parallel to Redwood Creek and back to the parking area.  \r\n\r\nRedwood Mountain Loop.  This 10-mile loop is a hike that combines both the Sugar Bowl and the Hart Tree Loops.  It makes for a good dayhike or a nice overnight experience.  \r\n\r\nThere are two additional trails that don't take the hiker into the canyon, but do provide nice views of the canyon.  Follow the instructions to the trailheads below:\r\n\r\nBuena Vista Trail.  This easy, 2-mile hike provides great views of Redwood Canyon, Buck Rock and the high peaks of Kings Canyon.  The trailhead is 6 miles south of Grant Grove on the Generals Highway, and on the right just past the Kings Canyon Overlook.  The trail rises 450 feet in elevation and passes through several wildflower areas, and some beautiful stands of Jeffrey Pines.  \r\n\r\nBig Baldy.  This 4-mile hike follows the Big Baldy Ridge.  It will reward the hiker with more wonderful views of Redwood Canyon and the high country peaks.  Drive south on the Generals Highway for 8 miles to the Big Baldy Trailhead.  The 600-foot elevation gain to Big Baldy (8,209 feet) affords a dramatic, 360-degree panorama.  ", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Giant Sequoias.\r\n\u201cThey never lose their god-like composure, never toss their arms or bow or wave like the pines, but only slowly, solemnly nod and sway, standing erect, making no sign of strife, none of rest, neither in alliance nor at war with the winds, too calmly unconsciously noble and strong to strive with or bid defiance to anything.\"\r\n\u2013 John Muir, Our National Parks\r\n \r\nRedwood Canyon is in Kings Canyon National Park, CA.  It is the location of the world\u2019s largest grove of Giant Sequoias, with over 15,000 trees in its 4,000 acres.  Within the canyon are 16-miles of Class 1 hiking trails suitable for a day hike.  These trails are easy, with a couple short loops for day hiking, or even for spending the night on.  They are entirely suitable for taking pre-teen children on a genuine wilderness adventure.  The trails run by Redwood Creek, past some beautiful cascades and through a mixed conifer forest.  There are no real opportunities for bouldering, rock climbing or mountaineering within the canyon itself.  But, there is the very unique opportunity to actually spend a night under a Giant Sequoia in the world\u2019s largest grove of these magnificent trees.  In fact, the October 2007 issue of Backpacker magazine rates Redwood Canyon as one of the top fifty campsites in the U.S. (\"Best Place to Feel Small\", pg 62).

At an elevation of 10,300 feet, Mosquito Flat starts at an altitude many trails struggle to attain.  As a result, this area is perfect for even the most inexperienced hiker due to its accessibility to easy trails.  The area is a haven for photographers, fishermen, botanists, backpackers, and anyone who loves the backcountry.  Two very popular hikes can be started from Mosquito Flat ranging from easy to strenuous, both leading to spectacular areas of Rock Creek's backcountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Morgan Pass Trail winds through Little Lakes Valley (see movie clip above found on YouTube), a beautiful area containing several lakes, incredible wildflowers, riparian meadows, and excellent views of the 13,700+ foot peaks surrounding the valley.  Several species of wildlife thrive in the valley, including marmot, deer, chipmunk, squirrel, pine marten, pika, and many species of birds and fish.  Although small brook trout is the most prevalent species of fish, 3-5 pound browns are caught out of these lakes every summer.  Some lakes have wild rainbow trout in them as well.  This is a heavily-traveled trail, especially in July and August.  \r\n\r\nMono Pass is another hike that is started at Mosquito Flat.  This hike is much more difficult than Little Lakes Valley, and is drier, particularly on the upper slopes.  This hike does have its advantages, however.  Incredible views of Little Lakes Valley can be had from various points along the trail, fewer people use this trail compared to the Little Lakes Valley trail, and Ruby Lake, a large, secluded, and picturesque alpine lake, is accessible from here.  The Mono Pass Trail continues west over the Sierra Crest and drops down into the Mono Creek Recesses and Pioneer Basin.  The pass tops out at an elevation of 12,000 feet.  Access to lakes containing golden trout can be achieved from this trail.  Golden Lake at the headwaters of Mono Creek and Summit Lake at the top of Mono Pass are 2 of these lakes.  Mono Pass is very popular with the Rock Creek Pack Station.  Popular pack station trips are to Fourth Recess Lake and Pioneer Basin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHilton Lakes\r\n\r\nThe Hilton Lakes are situated in a wooded, moist, lake-filled basin, and are very popular with fishermen and backpackers, as well as the Rock Creek Pack Station which takes several pack trips into the area each year.  The trailhead for the Hilton Lakes is about 1/2 mile beyond Rock Creek Lakes Resort on the right, or about 1/4 mile below the Rock Creek Pack Station.  Adequate parking and bear boxes for storage are present at the trailhead, along with a restroom and public telephone.\r\n\r\nThe trail leading to the Hilton Lakes is dusty and dry, and is used heavily by pack animals.  There is very little water on the trail and the hike is roughly 5 miles to Hilton Lake #2 and Davis Lake.  The lakes themselves are beautiful.  Trees thickly line the shore and slopes at both Hilton #2 and Davis Lake, and the entire basin that holds these lakes is very wet.  As a result, mosquitoes are a constant nuisance in the Hilton Lakes area during the early-mid summer months.  Hikers should come prepared for the worst possible mosquito conditions.  The upper Hiltons are less-wooded and drier than Davis Lake and Hilton #2, and fewer people travel to these lakes.  For more serenity and fewer mosquitoes these lakes are a great alternative.\r\n\r\nFishing in the Hilton Lakes is excellent.  Brook, rainbow, and brown trout thrive in the lower lakes, and goldens can be found in the upper Hilton Lakes.  Fly and lure fishing are the most productive form of fishing, although live bait will also work well in these lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Rock Creek Lake\r\nTamarack Trailhead\r\n\r\nThe Tamarack Trailhead is located at Rock Creek Lake at an elevation of 9,700 feet.  This trail leads to 5 named lakes and many other un-named ponds.  This area is much drier than Little Lakes Valley.  Very few people take this hike, and it can be very rewarding due to the seclusion of the area.  East Fork is the main creek that drains this section of Rock Creek Canyon.  Dorothy Lake, Francis Lake, and the Tamarack Lakes are the most popular destinations for hikers on this trail.  The easiest route for climbing Mt. Morgan is accessible from this trailhead.  Use Francis Lake as a base camp if you don't want to try it as a day hike.\r\n\r\nFrancis Lake is incredibly scenic despite its small size.  In early summer, wildflowers add to the lake's beauty.  The easiest route for climbing Mount Morgan is accessed from here.  Insects including mosquitoes may pose a problem at Francis, especially in the early-mid summer months.  Campsites are present near the lake\u2019s outlet.  \r\nDorothy Lake is another lake accessible along this trail.  There is a beautiful, expansive meadow as you approach the lake which is filled with wildflowers in the early summer.  Wildlife may also be spotted in the meadow.  Campsites are scattered along the entire lakeshore.  This is an excellent spot to use as a base camp for hikes to the Tamarack Lakes, Francis Lake, and Wheeler Crest.  \r\n\r\nThe Tamarack Lakes are perfect examples of rugged glacial remnants.  Rocks left behind by receding glaciers have dammed up the lakes, and their high elevation of 11,600 feet keeps most people and animals out of the area.  As a result, the water in Tamarack Lakes is crystal clear.  This hike is worth it for hikers that enjoy alpine lakes at or above timberline.  Bighorn Sheep have been seen along the ridgetops around the Tamarack Lakes area, one of the few areas in the Rock Creek drainage where they're occasionally spotted.  Brook trout occupy the lakes, and it's rumored that goldens also are present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Location": "California,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

The hike starts at a little chapel. The trail descends a little and then ascends and traverses the south slopes of Punta Finosa. This part is without shadow and very hot in summer. You have nice views back onto the citadel of Corte, the mountains east of Corte and the Punta di Zurmulu and Punta a u Finellu, limiting the Tavignano valley to the south.\r\n\r\nFor the first three km the valley is still broad but rugged and remote. It is a beautiful hike through thin pine woods and macchia with the many aromatic plants of the island. The trail then traverses two side valleys coming down from the Punta Finosa and reaches the point 760 m on the IGN map (about 300 m of altitude difference from Corte). The valley becomes narrow now and the trails winds along the north side on steep slopes crossing rock slabs from time to time.\r\n\r\nAfter about 1,5 km the trail hits the valley ground at a footbridge. If you cross the river you can go on into the direction of Refuge de la Sega (1166 m). The trail starts ascending again after the bridge and the gorge broadens again after about 1 km up the footbridge.\r\n\u00a0Refreshing pond near the footbridge (07-2007)\r\nMost day hikers take their break at the footbridge. In the surrounding of the bridge are many refreshing ponds cut smoothly into the granite rock, a great place to have a nice little refreshment. The best ponds in my opinion are situated a little upstream the bridge. Use the trail on the north side of the river, go on for about 300 m and descend to the river.\r\n\u00a0Tavignano canyon  (07-2007)\r\nRound Trip\r\nIf you have enough time and strength and you don\u00b4t want to go back on the same trail there is an interesting round trip. But be warned, this is not a short hike (about 16 km long) ! You need the whole day for that.\r\n\r\nFrom the footbridge continue on the northern, orographic left trail. The trail starts to ascend and after about 400 m it gradually leaves the Tavignano gorge, climbing up the north slopes of Capo Nero, a subsummit to Punta Finosa. After 600 m of altitude difference the trail reaches a forest and fire road with a hut. Leave the road after the hut on a trail to the right. Stay right at the next trail junction after a side valley, coming down from Capo Nero. \r\n\r\nThe trail traverses now the west slopes of Punta Finosa and reaches Bergerie de Conia (1593 m). Follow the forest road from the Bergerie in eastern direction up to Bocca a Canaghia (1770 m).\r\n\r\nFrom Bocca a Canaghia you can easily summit Punta Finosa (1855 m), south of the col or Pinerole (1951 m; 1.500 m of altitude difference from Corte parking area !!), north of the col. Those are off-trail hikes but not difficult ones.\r\n\r\nThe road descends from the bocca in eastern direction and ends at Bergerie de Padule. Take the trail to the right which ascends slightly up to the east ridge of Punta Finosa. After tarversing the ridge at abou 1670 m the trail starts to descend continually down to Corte (parking area: 453 m). This is about 1.200 m of altitude difference !\r\n\r\nAt 1451 m you pass by the Arche de Corte or Arcu di u Scandulaghiu, a natural arch in the rockface. The trail is very scenic because of the views into the central valley and the eastern mountains. \r\n\r\nYou can do this round trip the other way round, too. But remind, the ascend to the Arche de Corte and the Bergerie de Padule is an eastern slope with full morning sun and no shadow. Better to have this as a descent and in the evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "\u00a0The statue of Pasquale Paoli at Corte center (07-2007)\r\nThe trailhead for Gorges de Tavignano is directly at Corte.\r\n\r\nYou reach Corte in the central Corse valley easily:\r\n\r\n- on road N 193 from Bastia / Ponte Leccia or from Ajaccio\r\n- on road D 84 and D 18 from Porto, Sagone, Carg\u00e8se on the west coast\r\n- on road N 197 and N 193 from Calvi, Saint Florent and the north coast\r\n- on road N 196, N 198 and N 200 from the southern and southeastern parts of the island\r\n\r\nAt Corte keep in the northern parts of the city, north of the center and the Citadelle.

{"Activities": "Hiking", "Getting There": "\u00a0Gorges de Spelunca (july 2007)\r\nFor this hike you can start at Evisa, Ota or at the Ponte Vecchiu near Ota. Each trailhead offers some parking areas.\r\n\r\nThe next railroad stations are quite far away. I don\u00b4t know if there is a regular public bus service to one of the trailheads.\r\n\r\nEvisa\r\nMost people start from Evisa to experience the canyon by descending it. Evisa is a remote mountain village which can be reached by car, using the\r\n\r\n- road D 84 east from the central Corse valley (from Corte or Ponte Leccia on road N 193 to Francardo, at Francardo follow D 84)\r\n- road D 84 west from Porto / west coast\r\n- road D 70 from Sagone / west coast\r\n\r\nThere are possibilities to park the car at the lower western end of Evisa. The trailhead is at the cemetery about 500 m west of Evisa along the D 84.\r\n\r\nRoad D 84 between Evisa and Ota offers spectacular views into the canyon. There are several turnouts for foto-hikers.\r\n\r\nPonte Vecchiu\r\nThis trailhead is at the lowest point of the whole hike. The road D 124 connects road D 84 with the village of Ota. Use D 124 in the direction of Ota at the D 84 / D 124 intersection between Porto and Evisa and follow D 124 down the valley. The Ponte Vecchiu, a wonderful old Genovese stone bridge over Rivi\u00e8re de Porto, offers some parking possibilities at the switchback of the road, where it crosses the river.\r\nThe trailhead is on the orographic left side of the river.\r\n\u00a0Ota from Gorges de Spelunca (july 2007)\r\nOta\r\nOta is a mountain village near Porto. It can be reached by car following D 124 from Porto or from the above mentioned intersection with D 84. Look out for places to park your car inside the village. The trailhead is in the more western parts of the village. Use the lowermost road of the village from the intersection with road D 124; it will lead to an old and partly overgrown farm road which descends to the Ponte Vecchiu.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Capu d\u00b4Ortu from Ota (july 2007)\r\nThe Gorges de Spelunca stretches between the villages of Evisa (east) and Ota (west), east of Porto in the western part of the Corse island. It is a rather short canyon of about 2 km of length, deeply cut into the granite massive of central Corse. From Evisa (876 m) it is about 650 m of altitude difference to the bottom of the canyon. The Tra Mare e Monti trail makes the canyon accessible for hikers.\r\n\r\nMost hikers do the canyon as a one way trip and return to their trailhead by taxi, a second car or they try to hitchhike.

It starts descending the northwestern slopes of the mountain plateau on which Evisa is erected. It leads through dense woods with some nice views into the canyon.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour the trail gets steeper and zigzags down to the valley bottom, passing steep rockfaces, rock spires and nice vista points. The trail is very good maintained, in some parts erected on a sort of stone walls for extra stabilisation.\r\n\r\nThe trail reaches the valley bottom at Pont de Zaglia, an old and beautiful Genovese stone bridge, thus showing that the trail was an old and important communication road in former times. You cross Pont de Zaglia and follow the trail on the orographic left side of the canyon. The trail cuts through stone and rock faces, balances atop of granite slabs and offers from time to time access to beautiful bathing ponds.\r\n\r\nAt last it reaches the road D 124 at the end of the canyon.

These rocks are relatively soft and subject to swift erosion from the effects of the slightly acidic water that percolates through it. Because of this tendency to erode swiftly from the acidic action of the groundwater, the Ozark plateau in this part of the state is honeycombed with vast cave systems.\r\n\r\nOne of these cave systems collapsed about 10,000 years ago. Roughly a one-mile stretch of cavern had its roof give way, revealing a deep scar more than 130 feet deep. With a width that is less than the depth in many places, this canyon is actually a true chasm, and arguably the most spectacular physical feature in that part of Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Gulf is protected as a small state park and natural area. There \u00a0Where's Kong?are a number of trails that navigate the rim of the canyon, and one that descends to the floor of one branch of the chasm. However, there are no official trails into the base of the canyon itself. There are, though, several unofficial trails that one can take to the bottom to get the best views of the Grand Gulf.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of the Gulf is a section of the former cave roof that did not collapse with the rest of the cave 10K years ago. This section is now the largest natural stone arch in the state. One side of the arch is over 75 feet high, while the opposite end is about ten feet high. It's quite an experience to walk beneath it and look up at the limestone roof.\r\n\r\n\u00a0TrailsThe floor of The Grand Gulf is quite lush with plant life and rather damp. There was once a cave outlet at the low end that could be navigated, but a flood in the 1920s permanently plugged the cave entrance. Because of this plug, the chasm sometimes fills with water to a depth of 100 feet and which drains slowly over the course of weeks to reveal the chasm once again.

{"Activities": "Hiking", "Hiking Trails": "South Rim\r\n\tThe south rim trail stretches 3.2 miles from the Chittenden Bridge, just upstream of the Upper Falls, to Point Sublime. This trail can be done as shuttle from Artist Point to the Wapiti Lake trailhead or an out and back from any section of the trail to another. Views include those of the Upper Falls from its namesake overlook, the Lower Falls from Artist Point and other various spots, and an expansive view of the canyon from Point Sublime.\u00a0Artist Point\r\n\r\nRibbon Lake\r\n\tThis trail is best started from the Artist Point parking area. From here, head for Point Sublime on the rim trail, hiking right along the canyon\u2019s edge. After half mile turn right onto the Ribbon Lake trail before reaching Point Sublime. Turn left at the next junction with the Clear Lake trail less than a half mile from the rim trail. The next mile will be mostly in the trees until reaching Ribbon Lake. Follow a trail around the western side of the lake to the Silver Cord Cascade Overlook, where you will suddenly be standing on the canyon\u2019s edge again, peering down the 1,200 foot drop to the Yellowstone River.\u00a0Upper Falls\u00a0Uncle Tom's Ladder\r\n\r\nUncle Tom's Trail\r\n\tThis is a trail unique from most, because it really isn\u2019t a trail, but a series of steep stairs. Climb down the 328 steel mesh steps from the south rim to a viewing area very close to the base of the powerful Lower Falls. This is a short distance to hike, but climbing back up the staircase can be strenuous.\u00a0Crystal Falls\r\n\r\nNorth Rim\r\n\tThe views from the North Rim trail rival those from the south rim. And like the south rim, the North Rim trail can be done as a shuttle, from the Chittenden Bridge to Inspiration Point (3 miles) or hiked in desired sections. From the bridge it\u2019s a short \u00bc mile to the Brink of the Upper Falls. Here the Yellowstone River plunges 109 feet and marks the start of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Crystal Falls on Cascade Creek is reached just before your first mile of hiking. The trail actually crosses right over top of the falls. Shortly after crossing Cascade Creek, you\u2019ll pass the side trail leading to the Brink of the Lower Falls. Half mile past this junction is the short side trail to Lookout Point. And just past here is the side trail down to Red Rock Point. Both side trails give amazing views of the canyon and its Lower Falls, but the Lookout Point trail is a 50 foot stroll, while the Red Rock Point trail is a steep quarter-mile drop. Finally the paved trail dwindles to a normal dirt and rock hiking path once you get to Grand View Point, which offers more memorable views of the Lower Falls. From here the trail stretches another 1.5 miles to Inspiration Point and its inspiring views with a very broad glimpse of the Grand Canyon before it.\r\n\r\nBrink of the Lower Falls\r\n\tThe easiest and shortest way to get to the brink of the Lower Falls is by starting onto the north rim trail from a large parking area just before the one-way North Rim Drive rejoins the Grand Loop. It\u2019s only a 1.5 mile roundtrip hike, but offers one of the most breath-taking views in the entire canyon. Standing on the cement platform, looking over the railing, the waters of the Yellowstone River seem to be within your reach just as it drops 308 feet. Looking downstream, canyon walls look more like soft paintbrush strokes of pink, yellow, gold, red, brown and every hue in between. And if you are there at the right time of day the sun streaks through the mist of the falls below creating an amazing waterfall in your foreground shot of the canyon. \u00a0Brink of Lower Falls\r\n\r\nSevenmile Hole\r\n\tFind the Glacier Boulder trailhead on the road leading to Inspiration Point. It will be on the right. The trail begins away from the canyon rim in a lodgepole forest. With the exception of a few glimpses through the trees, the canyon itself is not visible for the first mile until you reach the Silver Cord Cascade viewing area on the south side of the canyon. Another mile down trail you will reach the Mount Washburn trail junction. Take a right here, and after another half mile the trail starts its plunge over the rim with a series of switchbacks. The 2.5 miles from the rim to Yellowstone River passes a geyser and a small thermal area. The distance from the trailhead to the Yellowstone is 5 miles, but I guess can feel like 7 when hiking back out. The Sevenmile Hole actually refers to the distance downstream from the Lower Falls.\u00a0Tower Falls\r\n\r\nTower Falls\r\n\tThis hike is the only other way by trail down into the canyon bottom, which at this point, marks the end of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, and is a must do. It\u2019s only about a mile in length from the overlook of Tower Falls in the Tower area (about 18 miles north from Canyon Junction on the Grand Loop). The trail was meant for the viewing of Tower Falls, a 132 foot waterfall dropping from rocky spires at its brink. After taking in the falls follow Tower creek downstream until it disappears into the Yellowstone River and the end of its Grand Canyon. \r\n", "Getting There": "There are plenty of ways to explore the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. First and foremost you have to make your way into Yellowstone National Park in the North West corner of Wyoming. Once there make your way around the grand loop following obvious signs or your handy brochure given to you by the rangers at any entrance to the Canyon area. The canyon offers several hiking trails ranging from easy to strenuous. But if you aren\u2019t much for adventure or exercise you can still see some of the best the canyon has to offer from the comfort of pavement and railings. From the Canyon junction you can take the roads leading to Inspiration Point, which is nothing short of inspirational. Back track from here to the one way road leading to Grand View and Lookout Point, and then eventually dumping you back on the grand loop road about a mile south of the canyon junction where you started. Take a left onto the grand loop for another half mile to the two way road on your left leading to the brink of the Upper Falls. A half mile past this road, further south on the grand loop, you will find a large sign on the left, pointing you in the direction to Artist Point. I recommend getting an early start to your day to do this roadside tour of the canyon to avoid the crowds, especially in the summer months.

{"Routes Overview": "Kane Gulch\r\n\r\nKane Gulch is by far the most popular entry into Grand Gulch.      The route is easy, and class 2, but one ledge can be dicey in winter if it is covered with ice.\r\n\r\nThere are some nice aspen trees and a few ruins in this canyon before reaching Grand Gulch.      The one way distance to Grand Gulch is 3.8 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nJunction Ruin\r\n\r\nTodie Canyon\r\n\r\nTodie Canyon has many archeological sites, but is a steep and rugged class 3 route.       The route is not recommended for winter unless the area is free of snow.\r\n\r\nThere are many ruins in the canyon, and the lower end has a small but nice little stream, but it doesn\u2019t flow very far.     The one way distance to Grand Gulch is 1.4 miles.   \r\n\r\nCoyote Canyon\r\n\r\nNot far north of Sheiks Canyon is Coyote Canyon.  A seldom used and rugged route descends into Grand Gulch from this canyon.   Unlike Sheiks and Todie Canyons, I don't know of any ruins in this canyon, but it can be used to make a nice, but rugged loop with Sheiks Canyon.\r\n\r\nSheiks Canyon\r\n\r\nSheiks Canyon is another little used steep class 3 route into Grand Gulch.      It has ruins in the upper end and pictographs and some water in the lower end.      The route is not recommended for winter unless the area is free of snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nPictographs in Sheiks Canyon.\r\n\r\nBullet Canyon\r\n\r\nPerhaps the second most popular entry into Grand Gulch is via Bullet Canyon.      It\u2019s a long canyon, and long enough that it will have its own SP page (see the link above).       The route is 7.5 miles long, class 3, and there are many archeological sites, as well as good campsites and some water.      The route isn\u2019t recommended if there is snow or ice around in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart of the Bullet Canyon Route.\r\n\r\nPine Canyon\r\n\r\nThis is a rugged route and sometimes it requires a rope.      It is a seldom used route.     There is sometimes a wooden ladder fixed at one drop of the canyon.       If the ladder is not there, the route requires a rope and rappelling gear.    \r\n\r\nThere are some nice ruins and pictographs in Pine Canyon.     Pine Canyon drains into Step Canyon before reaching Grand Gulch.\r\n\r\nStep Canyon\r\n\r\nStep Canyon is another seldom used route.      There are some challenging dryfalls to pass, and several ruins and archaeological sites.     About half way to Grand Gulch, Pine Canyon joins Step Canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPictographs in Step Canyon.\r\n\r\nPollys Canyon\r\n\r\nPollys Canyon is just north of the Government Trail.     It is said to be a moderately challenging route, and has some nice ruins.\r\n\r\nGovernment Trail\r\n\r\nThe Government Trail is said to be the easiest route into Grand Gulch.     It was originally constructed in the 1930\u2019s by the CCC, but vastly improved in the 1970\u2019s.     This is the standard route to the famous Big Man Pictograph.\r\n\r\nThis route along with Collins Canyon is the recommended entry into Grand Gulch in winter, but sometimes the roads can be impassable after a big snowstorm.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiking the Government Trail.\r\n\r\nDeer Canyon\r\n\r\nDeer Canyon is a rugged and seldom used route into Grand Gulch.      It is the canyon to the southwest of the Government Trail.        There is at least one route out of the canyon between the two southern forks.       You had better talk to the rangers or consult Kelsey\u2019s Canyon Hiking Guide to the Colorado Plateau before attempting the route, as can be hard to find.  \r\n\r\nDeer Canyon itself has some ruins and pictographs.\r\n\r\nCollins Canyon\r\n\r\nCollins Canyon is said to be the second easiest route into Grand Gulch.      It is an old cattle trail.         There are some nice ruins and pictographs in the canyon, as well as an old cowboy camp.      In winter, and along with the Government Trail, this is the other route into Grand Gulch that is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrand Gulch near Collins Spring Canyon.\r\n\r\nWater Canyon\r\n\r\nSeveral forks of Water Canyon have routes into Grand Gulch, but the routes are very rugged.   The northern most fork is said to be easiest.\r\n\r\nShangrila Canyon\r\n\r\nThis is the first big fork on the east side of Grand Gulch when going up canyon from the San Juan River.  The fork between elevation 4945 and 5062 has a route down in.  \r\n\r\nSan Juan River\r\n\r\nIf you are rafting or canoeing the San Juan River, you can hike up Grand Gulch.

{"Activities": "Canyoneering", "Getting There": "Take I-5 to Ortega Highway exit( CA 74 )and head east on Ortega Highway about 12.5 miles to the intersection with Hot Springs Canyon Road. Turn left here. Hot Springs Canyon Road is signed as \"Lazy W Ranch\" and is just west of the San Juan Fire Station and a Park Ranger Station. You'll find a large dirt parking area (the San Juan Trailhead) about 0.7 miles from Ortega Highway, along with bathrooms.  A Forest Adventure Pass is required to park anywhere in this area.  Drop your recovery car here and head back to the Ortega Hwy.\r\n\r\nParking is not allowed at the Lazy W Ranch and is very limited near the camp's entrance.\r\n  \r\nDrive east on Ortega hwy until you reach Main Divide Truck Trail (its called a trail, but its a paved road)and turn left there.  Follow this road a few miles just past the upper San Juan Trailhead and access the Falcon trailhead from either end . The Falcon Trail is a short trail which connects the Blue Jay and Falcon Campgrounds and can be accessed for either campground.\r\n\r\nHead down the trail a couple minutes and you\u2019ll see an obvious use trail to the northwest heading down canyon, parallel to the beginnings of the creek.  That will take you to the first drop.   \r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\u00a0\r\nEstimated Time Required: 10 to 14 hours\r\nEstimated Distance: 6.75 miles\r\nElevation loss: 2500\u2019\r\nMandatory Rappels:  5\r\nRating:  4B \r\n \r\nSalamander Canyon will most likely leave you with great memories and absolutely no desire to go back.  The canyon has at least a dozen nice technical features, beautiful falls, deep pools, interesting formations and challenging down-climbing.  However you will pay for the fun. At least two thirds of the travel is a nasty, off trail slog.  Despite that, the canyons jewel, 160\u2019 Tanrverdi Falls, makes it all worthwhile.  It will surely be on every advanced canyoneer\u2019s \u201cto do\u201d list soon.\r\n\r\nDiffuculity\r\nI rated this canyon 4b because it requires difficult and exposed down-climbing, and/or advanced problem-solving and anchor-building skills at peak flows.  At least one member of your party should have advanced skills to deal with these challenges.  And don\u2019t even consider bringing a beginner into this canyon. \r\n\r\nThe canyon will certainly be the most enjoyable in wet, cooler months. However the shorter winter days will limit the daylight hours so be sure to get a early start.   During the summer months the canyon may be dry making the down-climbing significantly easier.  But the heat, bugs, stagnate water and ever present poison oak will make your life hell. During the winter be sure to wear a full wetsuit to protect yourself from the elements,(you\u2019ll be wet most of the day)debris and the poison oak.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t under estimate the amount of time this canyon will consume (as I did). While the canyon is only 6.75 miles long, most of the time your progress will be measured in \u201chours per mile\u201d, not the typical \u201cmile\u2019s per hour.\u201d  Strong canyoneer\u2019s should expect to spend 10 hours plus in this canyon, average folks 12 hours plus.\r\n\r\nThe key to this canyon is efficiently!  Remember down-climbing will usually be faster then repelling.  Set up simo-raps on the on the smaller waterfalls. Have scouts constantly leap-froging ahead to set up the next rap.  And try to limit rest stops to the repels and gear changes.  It\u2019s going to be a long day, move fast, and try to avoid the pain of doing the lower canyon in the dark.\r\n\r\n \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n", "Route Discription": "Leave the Blue Jay or Falcon Campground using the Falcon Trailhead.  After only a couple minutes you'll find the Upper Hot Springs Canyon use trail to the northwest and start heading down canyon.\r\n  \r\nThe approach trail could stand to be trimmed back a bit, but you shouldn't have much trouble following it. You\u2019ll be getting your feet wet real quick so be prepared.  The approach trail bypasses the first fall, Calius's Cascade, and continues down canyon. As you approach the second fall the use trail appears to end.  You\u2019ll have a choice here: Gear-up and rap into a deep pool or bypass it on an exposed use trail high on canyon right.\r\n \r\nJust after the second waterfall you'll enter narrow passage I named Frank\u2019s Single Track Rut. The Rut leads you to a short waterfall called Single Track Falls. Building an anchor here will be a challenge.  We used a meat anchor and I down-climbed to canyon right.  The down-climbing wasn't as bad as it looked, even at the peak water flows we encountered.\r\n\r\nIn a short distance you'll find the next obstacle, a very sweet, two stage waterfall called Life Raft Falls.  The first stage was a 15\u2019 low angle cascade that poured off to the right, then fell vertical for another 12\u2019 and finished by again cascading left for another 30\u2019. There was a good anchor in place off a tree; also there was an old,  braided nylon, fixed hand line there.\r\n\r\nDuring low water flow, skilled canyoneers, utilizing the fixed hand-line at Life Raft falls,  may be able to complete the upper and mid sections of this canyon without deploying a rope. \r\n\r\nAfter the three significant falls in the upper technical section you enter the semi-technical mid-canyon section.  While this section had several nice down-climbable water features, it was mostly tough travel through a debris clogged, slippery, watercourse.  No trail at all, and travel outside of the watercourse was mostly impractical.  In this section we down-climbed and /or jumped the 20\u2019 Mid-Canyon Falls.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of the mid-canyon slog the canyon opens-up and you\u2019ll notice a large drop ahead. You\u2019ve reached the top of Tanrverdi Falls, the 160\u2019 jewel of the canyon and the beginning of the second technical section.  This fall is near vertical with one short free section.  The water flow was great when we were there.  The rap is anchored on a big rock out-cropping just to the left of the falls and requires a short, exposed, and uncomfortable, swing-out onto the face to weight the rope.  The repel goes free for a short distance near the top.  As you continue to lower you inch closer and closer to the water flow.  About two thirds of the way down you move into the water and become completely immersed in the flow by the bottom.  I have to say it\u2019s the most exciting rap I\u2019ve ever done!  Anywhere!\r\n\r\nThe big rap was quickly followed by 3 other 20\u2019 to 40\u2019 raps: Lower Tanrverdi Falls, a short unnamed fall, and Last Falls. \r\n\r\nThe Lower Tanrverdi Falls anchor, consisting of a rock chock and a knot chock found very high, canyon left/center, was a little dubious.  I inspected it, the rock chock was loose, so I reset it.  The knot chalk seemed solid in the direction of pull and the two were well equalized.  I considered replacing the anchor with a couple pins, but time was starting to run short and we were a little cold so we used the existing anchor.  \r\n\r\nThe next fall had a sun faded, manky, single strand of webbing for an anchor.  We quickly replaced it with a new redundant anchor.\r\n\r\nThe Last falls rap basically had the same simple anchor as the last rap. This time we just used it.\r\n\r\nBad news; you\u2019ve had only covered 1/3 of the canyon. Good news; all the technical canyoneering of the canyon behind you.   Travel in the lower canyon is still very tough. No trail at all and it\u2019s seldom that you can put together a few easy steps.  Most progress is still in the watercourse where your foot either slides on slippery rock, slips on uneven footing, or gets hung-up on some unseen obstacle.  When you do get an opportunity to move to dry land you\u2019ll be bolder hoping or bushwhacking.  \r\n\r\nTowards the end of the day, when you\u2019re about a half mile away reaching the Lazy W Ranch, look for an exit trail canyon right.  Then continue down the road to the San Juan Trail parking area to recover your car.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "Oh!": "Did I say this is in suburban Orange County!!

It wasn't that scary swinging out to weigh the rope, and even with the increased lateral forces from the shortened anchor it's still plenty strong.\r\n\r\nThe anchor on lower Tanrverdi Falls could/should be improved.

It is found within the Salome Wilderness Area which encompasses 18,530 acres in the Tonto National Forest.  Created in 1984, the Wilderness ranges in elevation from 2,600 feet to 6,500 feet.  The Wilderness is named after Salome Canyon which traverses nearly the entire length. This area was home to the prehistoric Salado Indians, and ruins dot the area.  If you happen upon a ruin, please do not disturb artifacts as they are protected by Federal Law.  There are few trails that enter this wilderness and access can sometimes be difficult.  The main trails are the Cactus Butte Trail, The Jug Trail, Boyer Trail, and Hell\u2019s Hole Trail.\n\nThe canyon itself is typically broken into two sections, Upper Salome Canyon which requires a long approach and semi-technical canyoneering, and the lower section which is easily accessed and boasts some of the best technical canyoneering in Southern Arizona.  \u00a0\nThis is the first deep pool that requires a swim.The lower canyon is carved just beneath Dutchwoman Butte, and is comprised of basalt and granite in shades of pink and white.  Nicknamed \u2018The Jug\u2019, this lower section requires at least one rappel and multiple swims.  Using the American Canyoneering Academy rating system, this canyon receives a 3C II which indicates that it requires swimming and rappelling, there is strong water current and a waterfall, and it can be done in a half day, car to car.  The entire length of the trip is around 5 miles (1 mile of it in the canyon) and can be completed in about 4-5 hours.  \n\nPlease note several potential dangers of this canyon:\n\n1.  It can receive heavy runoff during the spring and monsoon season (July-August).  I have been there when the water is quite high with a heavy current.  Please use caution.\n\n2.  Due to the higher elevation and more northern location, the water can be quite cold much of the year.  You may consider wearing a wet or dry suit if you are not doing the canyon in May, June, or September.\n\n3.  The Naegleria fowleri amoeba killed a boy swimming in Lake Havasu in western Arizona, and has been found in Tucson\u2019s water supply.  The amoeba eats the brain and enters by snorting infected water through the nose.  Drinking the water has no effect.  It is found primarily in warm water in southern states, and is stirred up by wading in shallow water.  Although there is no evidence that it is found in the Jug, caution may be warranted. You can read the MSNBC story here.\n\n4.  There is plenty of water in this canyon.  I have had electronic equipment ruined.  We also had to drive two men back to Phoenix when they lost their keys in one of the pools.  Be sure to either bring equipment you don't mind getting wet, or packing your gear in dry bags or sacks.\n\n5.  Watch for rattlesnakes.  I personally have never encountered one in my four trips to the area.  However, others have...and the area around Roosevelt is known for Diamondback Rattlesnakes.  I have also encountered the Arizona Black Rattlesnake not too far from this area...so care is required.  Remember that rattlesnakes will not attack unless cornered.

Otherwise, go to your right and find a weakness that allows you down the wall.  From here, the walls steepen and narrow to about 20 feet, and the swimming starts to take over.  You will be swimming 50-100 foot pools interspersed with rock hopping and bits of class 3 downclimbing.\nThe water slide that marks where the real adventure begins.\n\nEventually you will get to a 50 foot waterfall (it could be dry).  This is the heart of \u201cThe Jug\u201d and the best part of the whole canyon!  There are two options here, to jump or rappel into the pool at the base of the waterfall.  Either method requires you to traverse the 20 foot sloping ramp on the right side of the falls to a chain anchor.  There are also several good bolts near the waterfall that you could rap off as well.  One is to the right of the waterfall down by your feet.  One is located above that one on the wall.  The ramp is slick when your shoes or sandals are wet!  Use caution.  Sometimes people tie a sling from the bolts near the waterfall to the ones at the end of the ramp for use as a handline.  Some people also opt to attach a short webbing hand line to the bolts at the end of the ramp, downclimb a bit, and jump into the deep pool at the bottom to avoid the rappel.  I recommend bringing your rope and harness and rappelling into the pool because you never know what the last flash flood has brought and dumped into that pool that you can\u2019t see.\nRappelling the waterfall.  The waterfall is unseen in the picture to the left.\n\nThe pool is deep enough that you need to swim while unhooking your belay device.  Be careful not to lose it!  There is an old ATC stuck in the rocks at the bottom of the waterfall as evidence of this!  I opted to just pull my rope through and swim out with my belay device still attached.  There are a couple of ledges underneath the waterfall that you may be able to get onto, but it all depends on how high the water level is.\n\nFrom there, enjoy the best that Salome has to offer.  Swim two large 200 foot pools until the canyon opens up and the walls end.  From there, find a trail to your right up the hill that connects with the road/trail you came in on and hike back to your car.\n\n", "Red Tape": "Group size is limited to no more than 15 people and 15 pack or herd animals in the wilderness.

From Ilanz towards Chur a local road runs also above the southern side of the canyon. It can also be used for reaching various points in the canyon.\r\n\r\nThrough the canyon, mostly just above the river, the line of Rhaetian Railways goes. So, most of visitors uses this option, or simply enjoy the scenery through the train windows. From the west, the railway stations follow in this order: Ilanz - Castrisch - Valendas/Sagogn - Versam - Digg/Trin - Reichenau.

It is, according to the odometer in my brother's old Toyota 4Runner, 2.2 miles east of the gas station and store at Stovepipe Wells.  Turn south onto this road.\n\nIt is 1.8 mi to road's end.  At first, the road is moderately steep and rocky but does not really require high clearance or four-wheel drive.  However, the last 0.6 mi do require 4wd because the \"road\" is a wash consisting of loose gravel.  In the 4Runner we were driving, 4-High was sufficient.  A barrier blocks the road at its end.\n\nRoute Description\nThe Trails Illustrated map says the route is one mile (one way) and describes it thus: \"Look for rock cairn marking route to the east around the dry falls at beginning.\"\n\nOkay, there are dry falls close to the beginning, and they are after a prominent junction of washes (stay left, as the other wash soon climbs steeply to cliffs, which I observed from a narrow ridge between the washes).\n\nHowever, I saw no cairn marking the route to the east around these falls.  Nevertheless, the way around them is obvious, and it is shown in a picture below.\n\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you're up for some extra challenge, though, climb those dry falls.  There are actually three of them.  The third is the smallest and easiest by far, and the second is the hardest.  All three are shown following the notes below.\n\nFirst dry fall-- something like 12-15' (sandy landing should you slip and fall) up very smooth rock, but there are some holds and stemming will probably be necessary; Class 4-5.2.\n\nSecond dry fall-- someone placed a rock at the base.  Without the rock, very few people would be able to climb this overhanging pitch, or what I should say is that very few people would take it on without the security of a rope.  It's not quite as high as the first one, but it's harder even with the rock, definitely a low Class 5.\n\nThird dry fall-- hardly worth mentioning.  It's smooth but only a few feet high.  Your feet might slip on the smooth rock.  That's all.\n\n \u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0 \n\nPast these falls, the canyon opens up again, but then it narrows as you go across some smooth rock like that found in Mosaic Canyon.  Shortly past there, the canyon opens and then narrows again to enter a slot leading to a dry fall steeper, smoother, and a little taller than the ones encountered earlier.  This is about one mile from road's end and presumably the end of the route noted on the map, but shortly before the slot, there was a cairn marking an obvious way around the slot on the east side.  I felt that I could have climbed that dry fall, though perhaps in rock shoes instead of hiking boots, but I turned back for reasons already noted.\n\nA look at the USGS Grotto Canyon quad suggests that the canyon continues for at least a mile beyond where I stopped.  Whatever is after that stopping point is for you to discover.

The current NPS map that people can get at the visitor center and other staffed locations in the park shows neither the canyon nor the road to it.\n\nIn all honesty, Mosaic is the prettier Canyon, but Grotto is nice enough and offers solitude.\n\nDisclaimer: I only went as far as the route described on the Trails Illustrated map for Death Valley National Park.

To do it in one day though you need rappelling gear and some sort of ascending device (ascenders or a prusik system). You will also need an 18 meter rope, webbing, and a descent ring. If you don't have this equipment, the hike becomes a 45+ mile slog on old mining roads which can be done as a backpack.\n\nThe route described here on this page will be the route that takes you down the Miners trail and Rappel.

This road goes down for about 1 mile and comes to a fork in the road. Take the left fork and start heading east. After about 300 meters the road ends and a cairned trail starts. Follow the well cairned route down through the remaining part of the Navajo Sandstone and onto the red Kayenta Formation. Continue descending through the Kayenta benches. When you see a large cliff that doesn't look like it can be rappelled, it can't. Look to your right for more cairns that lead you just above the cliffs around the bowl and to a prominent point. By now you are walking on the cliff forming Wingate Sandstone. Very few breaks in the Wingate cliffs are seen throughout Utah.When you get to the end of the point, you will notice there is a spot for a short rappel of about 15 meters, an existing stretch of webbing that was in good condition when we were there in March 2011, and areas that you can make your own anchor with new webbing if you wish. This is called the Miners Trail and Rappel. The Miners Trail is the cairned route you just followed and the rappel is sitting in front of you. This is a very easy rappel that involves a 10 meter steep slope followed by a 5 meter vertical section. A 20 meter rope is best to use and it's better if it's pretty thick as you will have to ascend back up your rope when you return so be sure it is secure.\u00a0Leave the rope there and have your ascenders or prusik ropes with you. The chances are slim that anyone else will be here with you on any given day you do this hike and if anyone else is, they are not looking to go out stealing ropes.\nDirty Devil River Panorama\nWhen you finish the rappel, descend the long talus slope 500 feet down towards the southeast and get to the Shinarump Bench, a member of the Chinle Formation. The river is still about 400 feet below you but you will follow this bench generally in a southeastward direction and hike around five points in the Wingate cliffs above you which covers a distance of about 2.5 miles. The first part of this bench is easy hiking on open flat rock but the second half of this bench becomes much narrower and you must weave your way in and out and over rocks at times barely skirting cliffs below you. \nDirty Devil River Panorama\n\nDirty Devil River Panorama\nWhen you round your fifth point, the bench will open up again and you will come across an old mining track that will continue all the way to the Poison Spring Canyon 4WD road. Walk on this old road for a very short distance and pass a large pile of petrified logs.\nDirty Devil River Panorama\n\nThe pile of Petrified Logs\nJust after the logs, look for cairns and route find down through the deep red colored Moenkopi formation and continue into the lighter colored White Rim Sandstone until you come to the river. This route is also well cairned and generally heads east. At the river, you are standing on White Rim Sandstone which is Permian aged and was deposited about 250 million years ago. That means you just walked through 80 million years of time in the rock record. I just think that's so cool!!! Once you are at the river, you should see a large canyon coming in from the east on the other side of the river. This is Happy Canyon and the cairned route should take you right to it. The river is almost always cross-able here with the exception of April and early May after a heavy snow year. The water may be running too fast during this time but in March 2011 when we were here it wasn't more than waist deep. I would advise taking extreme caution though if you have expensive photography equipment with you as I did.

The first way would be to get to Hanksville, Utah and continue on Highway 24 towards Capitol Reef.

Continue driving south on the dirt road for 35 more miles.\nWaterpocket Fold from Notom Bullfrog Road\nGo past the Burr Trail Junction, past the 4 concrete crossings of Halls Creek that very rarely have flowing water and turn right at the junction for the paved road that heads to Bullfrog.

This side road can is passable to very carefully driven passenger cars when dry. It's hopeless to all vehicles when wet like it was in March 2010 when we were there.\nNotom Bullfrog Road\n\nKeep in mind that with the exception of the short paved portion, these roads are Bentonite clay which means don't drive on it while it's wet! Although it is possible to drive all 35 miles to the Halls Creek trailhead in a raging blizzard with no visibility with a foot of snow and flowing rivers on the road in a Subaru sedan car in March (That was quite an experience), DO NOT do it!!! When dry, any car can drive these roads. Extra care should be taken on the Halls Creek spur road though.\n\nBTW, it was on this trip that we took that Subaru all the way down the Notom Bullfrog Road. We did have to walk the final couple miles of the spur road though. Many of SP users probably know how much snow and rain fell in the desert southwest in the winter of 2009/2010 making everything still snow covered even into March.\n\nThe other way to get here would be from Boulder, Utah. Take the paved Burr trail from Boulder until it enters the National Park in which the pavement ends.

Early spring and late fall are particularly beautiful here and you will be guaranteed solitude at these times. It was the last week of winter in March 2010 when I went through Halls Creek Narrows and the creek was still flowing although to my surprise the water was quite warm unlike the standing water in other slots we did that same week.There are two ways to do this canyon. One is to start at the Halls Creek Overlook trailhead, descend into Halls Creek and walk south until you get to the start of the narrows. The other way is to take the shortcut route which will be described in my route page that is added to this page.

{"When To Hike": "The problem with Samaria is the crowds. It has become one of the\" musts\" if you go to Crete and there are up to 3000 visitors a day. If you have the bad luck to pick one of those days, the atmosphere will be really spoilt. Starting at dawn (before the tourist coaches arrive) will give you a bit of a head start. It is possible to find good (and cheap) accommodation in Omalos. \r\nThe first buses arrive at around 7.30 am and from then on it is an uninterrupted stream of buses until about 11.00 am. \r\nYou can also start walking after 12.00, there won't be many people but you will most probably need to spend the night in Agia Roumeli because the last boat out will have left when you get there.\r\n\r\nAs far as the times of the year are concerned, the best time is in the spring: the weather is still cool and the vegetation is at its best. The worst time is in the middle of the summer during a heatwave. Give it a miss and come again at a better time.\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "If you get there with your own car you will be forced to get back to Omalos to retrieve your car so it is not such a good solution.\r\n\r\nAlternatively there are public buses going to Omalos every morning (only when the gorge is open). Once in Agia Roumeli you take one of the boats returning to Hora Sfakion (or Sougia and Paleohora if you prefer although there is no connecting bus to Hania) and take an evening KTEL bus back to Hania. \r\n\r\nIf you are not alone, you can share a taxi to Omalos. The cost from Hania is no more than Euro 40 for up to 4 persons.\r\n\r\nThe most common way to \"do\" the gorge is to book an organized tour. This can be done from most places on the North coast (some come from as far as Agios Nicolaos, which I wouldn't recommend because it entails an almost 24 hour round trip!). You will be picked up from and returned to your hotel. The buses are air-conditioned (generally not the case with public buses) and you have the benefit of a guide. This does not mean that you need to walk in a group: everyone walks at their own pace and meets at a prearranged time and place in Agia Roumeli. These tours are not very expensive. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n             The gorge of Samaria is situated in the National park of Samaria, in the White Mountains (Levka Ori) in West Crete. The highest mountain over the gorge is Mount Gingilos (2080 m).\r\nThe gorge of Samaria is 16 km long (this refers to the distance between the settlement of Omalos and the village of Agia Roumeli), starting at an altitude of 1250m and taking you all the way down to the shores of the Libyan sea in Agia Roumeli. The walk through the National Park of Samaria is 13 km (but you will have to walk the extra 3 km to Agia Roumeli.\r\n\r\n The very narrow passage near the end of the gorge is often called the \"Iron Gates\". None of the former inhabitants of Samaria knows why the place suddenly got this name. They were always known as \"Portes\" which means \"doors\" or \"gates\", but certainly no \"Iron\" anywhere!\r\n\r\n Inhabited for thousands of years, the gorge of Samaria has played an important role as a place to flee from the oppression of foreign invaders. Its geographical location, in the middle of the White Mountains as well as the ease with which it could be defended made it the ideal place for this purpose.\r\n\r\n The Samaria gorge contains a wide variety of species of trees, shrubs, flowers and other plants, some of which are unique to the area. The vegetation consists largely of tall cypresses, many of them centuries old. \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jun7,2003/May7,2007", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=35.26552&amp;distance_lon_9=23.96290&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">35.26552\u00b0N/23.96290\u00b0E</a>", "Route description": "The starting point of the walk through the gorge of Samaria is at Xyloskala, which is also the entrance point into the National Park. The name Xyloskala means \"wooden staircase\" (or ladder) and originates in the fact that in the past, the inhabitants of the gorge had built a sort of staircase out of pieces of wood and tree-trunks in order to get in and out of the gorge. This is because the entrance of the gorge is a very steep drop which would otherwise have had to be climbed.\r\nToday, there is a stone path winding down steeply for the first 2 km, with a wooden parapet to prevent accidents. You still need to step very carefully because due to the amount of visitors many of the stones are worn smooth and are slippery. In my experience most accidents tend to happen on these first two km. This part of the walk is also pretty taxing on the knees.\r\nThe altitude at Xyloskala is 1250 m and most of the walk is in the shade so that the heat is not an issue at the beginning. In fact, if you get there early in the morning you might even feel quite cold. \r\n\r\n After about 1,7 km (the 13 km through the National Park are marked by milestones every km) you arrive at the first rest place and spring, Neroutsiko, in the shade of large plane trees. \r\nFrom then on the walk down becomes a little less steep and eventually you reach the bottom of the valley. Still walking in the shade you will cross the riverbed (there probably won't be any water) two or three time until you arrive at another tributary (with a fair bit of water). A few minutes walk further on is the rest place of Agios Nicholaos, with water, toilets and a guard post. This is a very ancient place where there was a temple of Apollo. The cypresses standing there are slightly over 2000 (!) years old. You have now been walking about 4 km.\r\n\r\nFrom Agios Nicholaos to Samaria (3,5 km), you will cross the river several times and pass two springs where you can refill your water bottle. This is an easy part of the walk, in the shade and the path is pretty smooth. After climbing up a little and walking a while above the river, you go down into the riverbed again and after a few hundred meters walking in pebbles you reach the village of Samaria, across the wooden bridge on your left.\r\nSamaria is the main resting place for most walkers, with shade, benches, water, a guard post and (generally) a doctor in attendance. If you are experiencing any problems do not hesitate to go and see the doctor, there won't be another one and it is free.\r\nTake a walk around the ruined village. If you walk quietly, you are very likely to see quite a few \"kri-kri\" at the edge of the village, especially young ones. They get quite used to people and are not at all shy. \r\nMy advice is that you do not stop for more than half an hour, unless you are a practiced hiker, because otherwise your legs might start seizing up and you will find walking again difficult.\r\n\r\nThe village of Samaria was inhabited until 1962, at which point the National Park was created and people where forced to leave. It had been inhabited for thousands of years by wood-loggers (there are some remains of sawmills in the gorge) and was also a place where the partisans fighting the Turkish invaders could retreat. During the winter Agia Roumeli is not accessible through the gorge because there is far too much water in the river. There was only a difficult mountain path leading from Samaria to the sea. So when you sit in the (probably crowded) village of Samaria, have a thought for what life must have been for these people.\r\n\r\nTo carry on with the walk you need to cross the bridge again and turn left. Less than half an hour later the walk takes you into the riverbed again. This is the beginning of the gorge proper. At the point where you walk down into the riverbed you will see a sign warning you about stones falling. The danger of stones falling (from as high as 500 m!) is very real, especially when a high wind blows in the mountains or if it has been raining recently.\r\n\r\nFor the next hour (or two depending on how fast you walk) you walk mainly in the riverbed (it can be tiring on your feet if the sole of your shoes is thin), crossing the river on stones or make shift bridges a number of times. The cliffs tower above you. This is without doubt the most impressive part of the walk.\r\n\r\nAt km 11 you arrive at the shaded clearing of Christos, where you will find the last spring. A few minutes on you get to the \"Gates\", this very famous and very narrow part of the gorge. It must be one of the most photographed place in Crete! You will often have hold-ups passing this narrow part, especially if you get there around midday because people also come from Agia Roumeli to see it. \r\n\r\nOnce through the Iron Gates the gorge widens considerably and after another 2 km you reach the guard post (where you must surrender your ticket stub) and are out of the National Park and in the old village of Agia Roumeli. It was destroyed by a flood in the 50's and consists mainly of ruined houses.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, the path is very easy: flat and no stones but also no shade. If you get there in the summer at noon you will often encounter very hot conditions. But soon you see the sea in ahead of you and get to the new village of Agia Roumeli and the cooling sea.\r\n\r\n", "Red Tape": "You have to pay an entrance fee of Euro 5.00 to enter the park (free to children under 15, half price to students). \r\n\r\nThe path is maintained and is substantially better than \"normal\" paths in Crete. There are guards along the way (in radio contact with each other) who will help you in case of trouble or injury. There is also a doctor stationed in the abandoned village of Samaria. There are well-maintained springs on the way so that you do not have to carry too much water. There are toilets in places and plenty of rubbish bins. You find surprisingly little litter, considering the amount of people passing through every day. \r\nYou also get a set of rules, aimed at protecting the park and making the experience safe and pleasant for everyone.\r\n\r\nThe gorge is open only during the day time and if you want to start walking in the afternoon you will only be allowed in up to a certain point: the guards want to make sure that everybody who walks in also gets out before nightfall. This is the reason why they ask you to present your ticket on the way out as it (supposedly) enables them to know if there is anyone still in the park at night.\r\n\r\n", "Location": "Creta,Greece,Europe"},

A few trails at the northern and eastern ends receive medium-heavy use, but interior trails are seldom hiked and are begging for exploration by those that like challenging terrain and solitude.  \r\n\r\nBest visited in fall, winter, and spring because this is a low-mid elevation area that can get very hot in the summer.

Southern Californians are blessed to have wilderness areas like these to go backpacking in when the higher elevation mountains are snow-covered!\r\n\r\nThe San Mateo Canyon is rimmed by low mountains covered with chaparral and coastal sage.  Many deep drainages join the main canyon and hide a lush growth of vegetation, with sycamore and oak woodlands thick along their bottoms.

One of two canyons in this public area, this is the easternmost and more spectacular of the two.  Nicknamed 'Grand Canyon' by motorcyclists and mountain bikers, this canyon doesn't span more than 50 feet across, but boasts a 30-40 foot deep sandstone slot that lasts for almost 1/2 mile.  Most of the year, there are pools deep enough to wade, and some, to swim.  Located among junipers and sandstone, it is a hidden wonder in a seemingly flat high desert landscape.  This canyon can be joined with the western canyon for an enjoyable day of canyon scrambling.\nThe Slot Begins to Form\n \nFive times a year, the trails in this area are primarily used for the American Motorcyclist Association's trials for dirt bikes.  But don't let this fact deter exploring the canyon...the area is very pristine despite the motorcycle use.  \u00a0\nA Survey of the Canyon from the RimThe main evidence of their passage is the large parking area and the single-track trails that run through the area.  These single tracks look very much like mountain biking trails, are often used by mountain bikers, and don't show evidence of too much wear.  Despite its proximity to Albuquerque, most people do not know about this area.  The majority of the year it is usually deserted and open for solitude, hiking, bird-watching, canyon scrambling, and mountain biking.\n\nThe area lies on the southern end of the Nacimiento Mountains which is made up of granite, gneiss, and schist.  The Trials Area is mostly sandstone, and forms the southeast edge of the Colorado Plateau.  To the north and northeast lies the Jemez Pueblo Indian Reservation and the southern canyon country of the Jemez Mountains.  On the east is a spectacular red vertical face formed by the San Ysidro fault.  Far to the east, one can see the Sandias and the Ortiz Mountains.  Bordering the area on the south is NM 550, the Rio Salado, and White Mesa.  White Mesa is well-known for its gypsum deposits which are mined to make wall-board.\n\nThis canyon is non-technical but is very narrow in spots, has many pools, and requires wading and possibly swimming depending on the time of the year.  The American Canyoneering Academy rating for this canyon would be 1B I meaning that it is non-technical, can be done in a few hours, and may require some wading and/or swimming.  Remember to stay out of any canyon if there is any inclimate weather in the watershed area.

The canyon terminates north of Azusa. North of there, the canyon moves through the San Gabriel Mountains, eventually breaking off into two primary forks, East and West fork.\r\n\r\nWest Fork is broader, and draws its water from sources around Mt Islip, Crystal Lake, the Mt Hawkins area, and Cogswell Dam in the west. There are many popular trails in the area, some of which go into the San Gabriel Wilderness around Twin Peaks, which is one of the San Gabriel Mountain's best kept secrets.\r\n\r\nEast Fork is home to the famous \"Bridge to Nowhere\", at the foot of Iron Mountain's western ridgeline. This is one of the deepest canyons in Southern California, and the further north you head, the cleaner the water is, and the better the scenery.\r\n\r\nThere are places for sportsman guys to fish and hunt in the area. Fishing is mostly lightweight fly fishing, with some trout. Hunting depends on tags and sections. You can get more information from either the Forest Rangers Office, or from a local sportsman's store.\r\n\r\nOverall, this is a nice, rather historical canyon with a lot to offer for those who want a quick way to get out of Los Angeles and into somewhat-untouched wilderness. The water is generally cool, clear, and clean, and there are plenty of nice places to camp off the beaten path.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, this is Los Angeles County. I spend a great deal of my free time in and around this canyon and the various neighboring canyons. There is trash along the roads, along the streams, beer bottles everywhere, used condoms, tons of graffiti, endless pointless names etched into trees, and tons of people drinking and swimming in various pools. On the weekends, this area gets very busy. Please, take my words of caution, and park your vehicle somewhere out of the way of major foot traffic, yet in an area where you feel it will not be vandalized. Many low-life people from inside Los Angeles and neighboring cities and communities come up here and take advantage of the general lack of authorities in the area.\r\n\r\nIf you want peace, solitude, clean water, then you must beat feet and move into such areas as the Narrows in East Fork, Bear Creek and the San Gabriel Wilderness in the West Fork, and generally anywhere too far for a gang member to walk.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0", "Created/Edited": "Feb16,2006/Nov7,2012", "Gold prospecting": "One of the more popular uses for this area is gold prospecting.

To the east and south are the mountains that comprise the Peninsular Ranges and the Salton Sea, Southern Mojave, and Santa Margarita Watersheds.  \n\nThe Santa Ana River starts high in the San Bernardino Mountains southeast of Big Bear.  There Coon, Fish, Wildhorse, Cienega Seca, and South Fork Creeks come together within a couple of miles to form the river.  South Fork's water comes from snowpack on the north side of Mt. San Gorgonio, the highest peak in Southern California.  \n\nThe Santa Ana River flows west down a broad wooded river canyon that eventually narrows at the base of the San Bernardino Mountains where the Seven Oaks Dam was built in 1999.  This is referred to as the \"Upper Santa Ana River Canyon\" or \"Santa Ana River Canyon\".  Then the river flows down a wide rocky flood plain and down through the cities of Highland and San Bernardino and then continues west.  A good place to catch a glimpse of the river is from the 215/10 interchange in San Bernardino.  The river flows westward through portions of Riverside and Orange Counties.

{"Routes Overview": "Approach Routes:\r\n\r\nThere are three approaches to the base of the climb that will be discussed here.     See the route page for more details.\r\n\r\nOption #1\r\n\r\nThe easiest but the longest of the three approach routes is the one down Red Rock Canyon.      Old cattle trails can be followed for much of the way down canyon to the Yampa River.     Once the Yampa River is reached, you can follow more game paths down the river to Outlaw Park.\r\n\r\nOption #2\r\n\r\nAnother route, slightly shorter than the one above is to hike cross country from the Bench Road to the big bend in the Yampa River north of the mouth of Red Rocks Canyon.     You can scramble down to the river at the end of the point.\r\n\r\nOption #3\r\n\r\nThe most direct way to the base of the climb is to head to and climb down the gully to the river.   This is the most difficult route, and a very hot one when coming back out.\r\n\r\nOption #4 \r\n\r\nOption #4 is yet another option.      It is the same as option #3, but comes in from the rim to the north and is equally difficult.     The advantage is the views it provides, but it is a very rugged and strenuous route.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best route is option #1.    See the Approach Map for more details.\r\n\r\nCanyon Descent\r\n\r\nThe Key Saddle Route into the Outlaw Arch Canyon is reasonably easy (comparatively) once you know where it is. There is still some exposure and much scrambling.     Luckily, the hardest parts of the route aren't too exposed and the exposed parts of the route aren't too hard.\r\n\r\nOnce in the canyon, you will descend it to the river.   This requires some technical downclimbing as well as rappels of natural anchors, a few of which might be intimidating.     See the route page for details.\r\n\r\nHere we are taking a break to admire the beatiful walls in the canyon on our descent\r\n", "Activities": "Hiking,Mountaineering,TradClimbing,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "The Discovery of Outlaw Arch": "While climbing Outlaw Peak and descending Outlaw Arch Canyon, we discovered something special by surprise.     What we discovered in the canyon and on a bench on the side of Outlaw Peak was a large natural arch. On Spetember 30, I returned with Jeff Fox and got accurate measurements on the arch. At 206 feet, it turned out to be the 9th largest known arch in the world, and the largest \"new discovery\" reported in the United States since Wrather Arch (Paria River Canyon) was first reported in the 1950's. Only one arch since then has been reported to be over 200 feet and it is in Africa in 2004. One may wonder how an arch could be hidden for so long (until 2006!), but there are three main reasons. \r\n\r\n1. Since it stands against the cliff wall, it really isn\u2019t visible from the air unless you know it is there. Now that we know it is there, it is visible on photos taken from the air. \r\n\r\n2. The arch is not visible from below, and you can\u2019t get to it from below. \r\n\r\n3. The arch is well hidden in a remote canyon, and the route to get there is very obscure. \r\n\r\nBefore this one was discovered, the 10 largest known spans are below: \r\n\r\nLargest Natural Arches and Bridges \r\n\r\nOutlaw Arch from below.", "Getting There": "Note: Directions are going to be very brief and this is intentional. Pay attention to the landmarks when driving and make sure to use a good map. If you can\u2019t find the trailhead on your own, then this is not the right place for you to go climbing. I would suggest doing something like Longs Peak instead.\r\n\r\nBriefly put: To get to the trailhead drive to the park headquarters of Dinosaur N.M., which is a few miles east of the town of Dinosaur, CO (Dinosaur is located on Highway 40 just east of the Utah border). Drive north on the Harpers Corner road for north until the Echo Park Road (gravel) takes off to the right (east). Drive the Echo Park Road to a junction. Turn right at the junction and head east along the Bench Road. Follow this road to the head of Red Rocks Canyon and Park. The road is sometimes too rough for passenger cars after leaving the pavement. Moderate clearance vehicles such as Subarus should do OK, but low slung cars can sometimes have problems.\r\n\r\nLast rap in Outlaw Arch Canyon.", "Camping": "After obtaining a camping permit, you can camp anywhere 1/4 mile or more from the road.

This is a really nice surprise. Pull open any guidebook to Colorado with the hikes and climbs marked, and notice the big blank spot in Northwestern Colorado. This area of Colorado, without question, has the most remote peaks and canyons in Colorado and almost certainly even has some un-climbed peaks and untouched canyons. The peaks are incredibly spectacular and almost completely ignored, despite the fact that it offers some of the best scenery in the lower 48 states. Over a dozen very inaccessible peaks invite exploration. Only a few of the more accessible peaks are on Summitpost, but there is enough exploring here to keep one busy for years.\r\n\r\nThere are all kinds of spectacular canyons here as well. From big and scenic to tight slot canyons, this area has enough exploring left for years. There are literally dozens of seemingly completely unexplored slot canyons in the area. \r\n\r\n\u201dOutlaw Arch Canyon\u201d is the name we have given to this canyon because Outlaw Park is the nearest named feature (besides the Yampa River).     The canyon is seldom descended and we almost certainly made the first complete descent through the canyon in September 2006.\r\n\r\nLater we found that this canyon has been known to some local river rafters as \u201cScoggin Draw\u201d after the 1941 inscription mentioned near the mouth of the canyon.  It was made by Charles Scoggin, a researcher from the University of Colorado who contributed substantially to the Dinosaur National Monument archeology in the years just prior to World War II.  \r\n\r\nPutting these routes up is one thing I have been working on and off for the last three years. A route from the north proved too rugged and impractical. A route from Mantle Park didn\u2019t work out. There were a few more trips that ended without finding any viable routes to access the area. Finally in April 2006, we climbed the point on the south side of the river for a good close up view of Peak 6489 and the canyons surrounding it. We got off track and just happened to spot the couloir that would be the key to the lower part of the route. The upper part of the route was discovered mostly by accident when looking for routes into the nearby canyon. The obscure route up to \u201cKey Saddle\u201d proved to be the key that unlocked the door to accessing the nearby canyons.\r\n\r\nIn all my years of exploration in the area, I have only run into people in Jones Hole and Harpers Corner. The rest of the area is very little known. I\u2019ve found one cairn, no hikers, and no footprints in all my years of traveling here, even on holiday weekends. Over Labor Day weekend, there was neither a soul nor footprint to be found for miles and miles around.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and early summer, many rive runners do run the Yampa River Canyon, and these are about the only people using the area.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Bouldering,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "To get to the trailhead for these canyons, drive 19 miles east from Boulder, Utah on the paved (though terribly paved) Burr Trail road. This road is quite possibly one of the most scenic roads in Utah as it strategically weaves its way through the canyons and cliffs between Capitol Reef National Park and Boulder, Utah. After 19 miles, turn right and head south on the unpaved Wolverine Loop Road. Drive south for 12 miles to the Little Death Hollow trailhead. You will pass the trailhead for Wolverine Canyon. At the Little Death Hollow trailhead you will find an old corral and a drinking bucket for cows, as well as room for a few cars. A sign at the trailhead marks it as Little Death Hollow.\n\nIf you look southwest from the trailhead you will notice a large valley below a series of cliffs on each side. These are part of the Circle Cliffs made of the Wingate sandstone. The \"trail\" starts heading down this valley in a southwest direction.\u00a0Continue down the trail and after about 2 miles another wash will come in from the left. Stay right and continue downstream. At places you may get a little wet if there is water in the stream bed, mainly in the early spring or winter months. There is also a series of springs in the stream-beds that provide water in all months. At 4 miles from the trailhead the canyon really starts to narrow up. The really cool thing about Little Death is that the slot is 5 miles long! You will be continually walking in narrows for around two hours. Enjoy every minute of it as this type of slot is rare. The only obstacle you may encounter is a large chalkstone with a large puddle of water on the downstream side. In May 2010 when we did these canyons we had to wade through 2 feet of water to pass this puddle. The clay at the bottom of the water felt weird. The water-clay boundary isn't really there and your foot seems to sink down into a foot of water and a foot of clay!\n\n\nLittle Death Hollow Narrows\nLittle Death Hollow NarrowsLittle Death Hollow Narrows\n\nAt about 9 miles from the trailhead the canyon will open up into a large opening with many trees. This is where Little Death Hollow drains into Horse Canyon. If you were to head left (downstream) along Horse Wash you will hit the Escalante River in about a mile and a half. That is an optional side trip that will add three miles to the loop, maybe worth it if it's hot and you want to do a little swimming. Otherwise, turn right and head upstream in Horse wash. You will probably see an old road that looks like it's still used. Follow this to cut the switchbacks made by the meandering stream. After about 2 miles following this road look for a canyon opening coming in from the right. This is Wolverine Canyon and you should turn right here and enter the second canyon of your loop.\n\n\nHorse Canyon\n\nWolverine canyon isn't nearly as exciting or narrow as Little Death Hollow but it makes fro a nice 3 mile walk through some new scenery. The most important routefinding you will do on this loop is making sure you take the right wash after getting to the upper end of Wolverine Canyon.\u00a0After 3 miles in Wolverine Canyon you will come to a fork in the stream. The left fork takes you to the official Wolverine Canyon Trailhead. Your car isn't there and you will add 2.5 miles of road walking to your already pretty long hike if you head that way. We even saw a hand made rock arrow pointing to the left that was designed for people who parked at the Wolverine Canyon Trailhead. Ignore this large arrow.\n\n\nWolverine Canyon\n\nMake the right fork and walk cross country for 2 miles through the wash until you hit another small fork in the stream-beds. Take the right fork once again and walk another mile and a half to the road you came in on. You will have to make you way under an old barbed wire fence probably designed for cows right before you get to the road. Don't try to destroy this fence as it may still be used. I think it marks the boundary between the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and BLM lands. Along the way in this wash you will find thousands of petrified wood logs and chunks. This area is really amazing. Petrified wood will be seen all the way until you get back to the road. \n\nTo get back to your car, take a right (south) turn on the road and walk the short half mile to the official Little Death Hollow trailhead.\u00a0If you ALWAYS take right turns on this loop you will be set on the routefinding!\u00a0This loop can also be done in the other direction or even could be done starting at the Wolverine Canyon trailhead. The way we did the loop is how I described it here.\n", "Camping": "If you have a free permit obtainable at the BLM office in Escalante, you can camp anywhere except for the trailheads.\nIt's recommended you don't camp in washes though.\n", "Overview": "\n            Little Death Hollow and Wolverine canyons are two nice slot canyons that drain into the Escalante River from the lesser known east side. Situated between Capitol Reef National Park and the Escalante River just off of the Burr Trail, these canyons are pretty remote. A loop hike incorporating both of these canyons is 20 miles long and makes for an excellent day hike. There is no technical skills or gear needed to do these canyons. \n\nThe one very interesting thing is that they are composed of the Wingate Sandstone rock unit instead of the Navajo sandstone. This is actually quite rare because the Wingate sandstone is much more resistant than the Navajo sandstone and it tends to erode into larger \"gorge\" type landscapes. If you're familiar with southern Utah, the entire Orange Cliffs area west of Canyonlands National Park is all Wingate sandstone. The Flint Trail switchbacks that lead down into the Maze District of Canyonlands National Park takes you down the only break in the Wingate Orange Cliffs large enough to bulldoze out a road. Thats why the Maze District is known as \"Under the Ledge\" country.\u00a0These two canyons cut through a group of cliffs known as the Circle Cliffs. Similar to the Orange Cliffs, this is a long series of Wingate cliffs stretching for many miles.\n\nMillard Canyon of the Orange Cliffs that surround the Maze District of Canyonlands. All these large cliffs are the Wingate sandstone.\n\nIn contrast, every slot canyon in the Robbers Roost area (San Rafael Desert) is composed of lighter colored the Navajo sandstone rock unit. Next time you are around there, take a look around at the rocks you see. The large flat expanse of wasteland you see when driving on the Hans Flat road is all the reddish-brown, very resistant Carmel Formation. Sitting below the Carmel Formation is the Navajo sandstone. Where the Carmel Formation is completely eroded through, the erosive Navajo formation becomes exposed and deep slots are formed. Often, the initial transition from the Carmel to the Navajo is a large dryfall that would need to be repelled.\n\nThe deep Navajo narrows of Bluejohn Canyon\n\nSee the strat column below to gain a reference of the rock layers in southern Utah. These layers shown are in the Permian, Triassic and Jurassic time periods ranging from 65 to 200 million years of age. Next time you're in Utah, try to identify these rock units.\nStrat column showing the rock layers in the Escalante National Monument area\n \nDue to the resistance of the Wingate sandstone similar to the Carmel Formation, slots are rare. Thats what makes these two canyons so special. While most canyons you may descent are made of Navajo and have the white or pink color to them, Little Death Hollow and Wolverine Canyons are two slot canyons where the rocks are a red-orange color.\u00a0The other claim to fame these canyons have is the large amount of petrified wood surrounding the upper end of these canyons. The Wolverine Petrified Natural area has at times ten to twenty foot petrified logs simply lying around at the surface and are quite common. The Chinle formation, sitting stratigraphically one rock unit below the Wingate Sandstone was formed at a time when large swampy forests dominated the landscape. As geologic time progressed, these swampy forests were buried and became petrified. This rock unit was buried under thousands of feet of other rock layers until the Laramide uplift that caused erosion of many overlaying layers and exposing the large petrified logs at the surface.\u00a0Feel free to explore around but don't take any of the petrified wood.

The headwaters are at Potrero Seco in the eastern Sierra Madre Mountains, and it is joined by more than thirty tributary streams of the Sierra Madre and Topatopa Mountains, before it empties into the Santa Clara River in Fillmore. \u00a031 miles of Sespe Creek is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River and National Scenic Waterway, and is untouched by dams or concrete channels. It is one of the last wild rivers in Southern California.\u00a0\nThe name Sespe can be traced to a Chumash Indian village, called Cepsey, Sek-pe or S'eqpe' (\"Kneecap\") in the Chumash language in 1791. The village appeared in a Mexican Alta California land grant called Rancho Sespe or Rancho San Cayetano in 1833.\n\nThe inaccessibility of the Sespe Creek backcountry, related to the Sespe gorge and flash floods which make roads through the gorge impossible to maintain, has made the area an apparent refuge for a number of species who were extirpated elsewhere in southern California, including the California Condor, Southern Steelhead trout and possibly the California Golden beaver. In addition, the California Grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) held out in the Sespe area until at least 1905, when a forest ranger reported tracks and separately hunters claimed they saw a grizzly in the vicinity of the Sespe Hot Springs and Alder Creek.\u00a0The Sespe is one of southern California's last free flowing southern Steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) streams. \u00a0\nYou might also spot black bears, fox, deer, mountain lions, bobcats, coyotes, rattlesnakes, red-tailed hawks, and golden eagles.\u00a0The Sespe Creek flows through habitats of the California montane chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, and Riparian woodlands.\u00a0\n\nThe creek remains free from major habitat modifications and is noteworty for its lack of dams. After originating above 5,000 feet in the Sierra Madre Mountains in the northwest corner of the Ojai Ranger District, about 75 percent of the Sespe Creek watershed is characterized by numerous rugged slopes and canyon walls of the southern Pine Mountains. It flows intermittently but is characterized by a series of permanent deep pools. Major tributaries include the Lion Canyon, Hot Springs Canyon, Timber, West Fork Sespe and Little Sespe Creeks, although over 30 creeks and springs nourish it. Sespe Creek receives most of its rainfall between January and April, and furnishes 40% of the water flowing in the Santa Clara River.\n\nThe approximately 219,700-acre Sespe Wilderness Area encompasses 31.5 miles of Sespe Creek. Established in 1992, the Wilderness Area contains a 53,000-acre Sespe Condor Sanctuary. The stream is designated as a Wild Trout stream from the Lion Camp downstream to the Los Padres National Forest boundary north of and near the City of Fillmore.\n\nSespe Wilderness provides ample evidence of past violent geological upthrusts. The landscape is bleak and jagged, and if you climb high enough, you'll find pine trees growing at odd angles on boulder-swept hillsides.

During Salt Lake's regular warm thaws throughout the winter, the lower routes often melt out enough to allow climbing in the middle of the winter!  During the winter the Scruffy Band and some of the other cliffs on the north-facing slopes accumulate enough ice for some good water ice climbing. The most popular route, which is almost always \u2018in\u2019, is the Great White Icicle, which is near Coalpit Gulch and the Pentapitch Area.\r\n\r\nIn the summer the routes on the large south-facing granite slabs get very bright and very hot \u2013 be careful about getting caught on a multi-pitch climb there in the middle of summer, when temperatures can exceed 100oF and there\u2019s no shade in sight! Getting your toes burned from heated climbing shoe soles is not very fun .  Fall is usually considered the best time overall for climbing in the canyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Don't Forget to Check Out These Sister Pages!Big Cottonwood Canyon | Wasatch Alpine Climbs\r\nLittle Cottonwood Canyon is one of the three large canyons that carves dramatically through the +11,000 ft high Wasatch Mountains, dropping some 3,000 ft to the Wasatch Front Metropolitan area. Collectively these three canyons are known as the tri-canyon areas (Millcreek Canyon, Big Cottonwood Canyon, & Little Cottonwood Canyon), with the Cottonwood Canyons being popular for a multitude of activities such as cycling, hiking, snowshoeing, picnicking, backcountry skiing, fishing, mountaineering, and ice and rock climbing. Snowbird and Alta ski resorts, which often receive around 500 inches of dry powdery snow each season, are also located at the top of the canyon and are accessible via public transit. During the summer months you can enjoy a tram ride, festivals, and music concerts at Snowbird. The backcountry skiing areas here are world renown (especially in the Lone Peak and Broads Fork Wilderness Areas), although Powderbird\u2019s helicopter skiing services have been an issue of contention among skiers, the ski industry, and environmentalists. \r\n\r\nDuring the mid-1800s, miners sought their fortune in gold and silver in this canyon, and remnants of the old mines can still be found in the upper parts of canyon, especially around the Albion Basin Area above Alta. In fact, the town of Alta started as a mining boomtown, and was often ravaged by avalanches coming off of the Wasatch peaks, which occasionally destroyed the entire town. In its mining heyday, Alta was a violent town, considered by the Mormons in the Salt Lake Valley to be riddled in sin. Although, I\u2019m not certain if this is entirely correct, I remember hearing that Hell Gate Cliffs, which are passed just before reaching Alta, were named as such because the cliffs marked the gateway to hell (i.e. Alta). During WWII Alta was a premier training ground for the 10th Mountain Division, which later served the US in military combat in Europe\u2019s more extreme mountain environments. After the war, Alta became an important testing ground for studying avalanches, and many contributions to the forecasting and control work of avalanches came from here.\r\n\r\nAncient glaciers carved the spectacular vistas of the 8-mile long canyon, which is obvious upon seeing the huge U-shape of the canyon. The tributary gulches to the south were also glacially carved, leaving many rugged mountain cirques, although the main canyon was carved in such a way that most of these gulches are very inaccessible from the main canyon, and must be approached by climbing over mountain passes. It enjoys a prime location near the Great Salt Lake and the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley, bounded by smaller foothills. The combination of lake effect and the directing shape of the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley funnels much of Utah\u2019s winter storms directly up Little Cottonwood Canyon, which is why the resorts here usually see much more snow than Utah\u2019s other ski resorts.  The canyon is also one of the most avalanche prone canyons in North America, as is evident by the many avalanche slide area signs passed while driving up the canyon. There are some 30 avalanche paths that can reach the highway, and over 300 known major slide paths in the entire canyon complex. Because of this, during big winter snowstorms, UDOT often cannot keep the road safe, and it is occasionally closed until proper avalanche control can be completed (often stranding skiers up the canyon!).\r\n\r\nAlthough this canyon is only a few miles south of Big Cottonwood Canyon, the rock here is completely different. Friction face climbing and crack climbing predominate here on coarse and polished granite. As such, the routes often rise at a kinder angle, although in general the climbing here is more difficult. There aren\u2019t as many opportunities to top-rope here, as most of the climbing routes are multi-pitch. The valley bottom has open forests with many granite boulders that are popular for bouldering, especially during the midday summer head.\r\n\r\nHigher up the canyon there are climbing areas on limestone on Hell Gate Cliffs and Devil\u2019s Castle. There are also a number of alpine routes up Hogum Fork, and on White Baldy and the Pfeifferhorn, although the granite at the higher elevations has weathered in such a way that it is fairly loose and broken, especially when compared to the large expanses of unbroken granite lower down in the canyon. In the winter these gulches are premier areas for ski mountaineering, and many extreme routes can be found in the couloirs and bowls here. Some examples are the South Face of Mt Superior, The Pfeifferhorn\u2019s North Ridge and NW Couloir, N Thunder Mountn\u2019s Y-Couloir, and Lone Peak\u2019s east face.\r\n\r\nThe majority of climbing areas are found within the first two miles on the north side of the Canyon. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS) owns property all along the road at the base of the cliffs, and No Trespassing signs are posted. However, Ted Wilson and Rick Reese, representing the climbing community, have brokered a compromise with the LDS Church allowing climbers to cross this property to reach the crags. Please respect the fact that this is private property, and do your part to minimize the climber\u2019s impact on the area. The Wasatch Resort on the south side of the road also makes access difficult to the routes on the south side of the canyon, but no official compromise has yet been made with the resort for approach access.\r\n\r\nWhile there are many possible routes in the canyon, most of the routes listed in guidebooks are within a 15-minute hike from the road. Due to the laziness of local craggers, there are many unrecorded and unclimbed routes on the cliffs higher up the steep canyon walls.\r\n\r\nOn days off, there is a shaded old dirt road ascending the bottom of the canyon that is popular for hiking, jogging, and mountain biking. It can also be used for some approaches on the south side of the canyon.\r\n\r\nOne final note is the ice climbing in the canyon. The areas around Scruffy Band at the mouth of the canyon often offer intermediate to advanced ice climbing conditions. Near Coalpit Gulch, the Great White Icicle offers a great 5-pitch WI 3 route that is almost always \u2018in\u2019, and it is one of the most popular ice climbing routes in the Wasatch. In the summer the waterfall that forms this climb is also descended as a 3C II canyoneering route.  In the winter the sun often melts off the granite on the north slopes, so climbing can often be found here year-round. In fact, it\u2019s entirely possible to go rock climbing, ice climbing, and skiing here all in the same day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=40.57310&amp;distance_lon_9=-111.77610&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.57310\u00b0N/111.7761\u00b0W</a>", "Nearby Amenities": "Emergency Services\r\nDiall 911 from any  phone.

On the right high up the canyon is a huge ridge with a daunting east face \u2013 this is Perla\u2019s Ridge.

During periods when the river flowed fast, heavy pebbles were deposited. When the river had a medium strength flow, gravel was deposited. When the river flowed lightly, sand was deposited. Dust containing calcium carbonate was blown over it by the wind and washed in by the river. This calcium carbonate, combined with water, cemented the layers in a calcrete conglomerate.\r\nBetween 2 and 4 million years ago, continental uplift caused a split in the surface that formed the Tsauchab River.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "Getting to Shenanigans Canyon is actually pretty easy. To do the whole Canyon you must do a loop hike and there are many places to park to start and end your loop. The place I'd recommend you park is 4 miles out on the Cedar Point Road which heads east off Utah Highway 95 about .8 miles north on the Highway 276 junction. The entire loop will take at least 5 hours for the skilled canyoneer and up to 8 hours or more for larger groups and amateurs.\n \nThe Cedar Point road has been recently degrading and as of May 2011, it would have been difficult for low clearance cars to go much further than a mile, though still doable if driven carefully.\n \nTo get to the starting point drive four miles east on the Cedar Point Road where you will find a small road heading off to the right. This road goes maybe a half mile and ends. This is where you'll park and you will see a panoramic view overlooking Butler Wash. If you are nestled into a wash bottom you took the wrong spur road. Make sure you check the mileage on your car when you first turn off Highway 95.\n\n\nNorth Wash Canyons\n", "Shenanigans Canyon Part 1 ": "\nUpper part of Shenanigans\u00a0\nShenanigans Canyon\u00a0\nShenanigans Canyon\nShenanigans Canyon\nAssuming you start from the place described above, you can walk the spur road back to the main dirt road and head about another mile up the road until you see a small pull off where you then can hike cross country due east towards the upper end of Shenanigans. This is the long way though. I'd recommend walking up the spur road about 500 feet and then veer right off the road and head cross country in a northwestern direction near the rim of Butler Wash. Stay high and back far enough from the rim so that you aren't going up and down the many small washes in the lower member of the red colored Carmel Formation. The more orange colored upper member is much gentler.\n\nYou will find yourself along the rim of the West Fork of Butler. Walk along this rim until you get to the very upper reaches of the west fork and then cross the drainage and head over the ridge separating the West and Middle Fork. Shenanigans Canyon is the same as the Middle Fork of West Butler. The Middle Fork is considerably longer than the west so you'll have to head further north after rounding the west fork.\n\nWhen you  get to the first drop into the Middle Fork walk around to the east side and down climb some steps to the ledge below where you will find a rappel anchor around a pile of rocks. You can either rappel down the chute here or walk around to the east side and find a route down the steep Navajo Sandstone. This down climb isn't very easy and is exposed but is doable for an amateur canyoneer to avoid rappelling. \n\nOnce at the canyon bottom head down stream where you will find perfect canyon walls for stemming and bridging. It is actually very annoying to walk the bottom of the canyon in the upper part. You'll come to a narrow chute about 15 feet high that you'll have to friction slide down using the canyon walls. I'd recommend you wear jeans. Once you pass this slide down there is no escape until the first exit. You can rest here and exit if you need to. \n\nIf you are not equipped with rappelling gear and you down climbed all the drops in the upper third it would be wise to exit here although it is possible that the second part of the canyon be down climbed if you are very experienced.", "Overview": "\n            Shenanigans Canyon is a technical canyon that drains into the West fork of Butler Wash located in the southern part of Robbers Roost Country. It drains into North Wash which then drains into Lake Powell. This canyon isn't for the claustrophobic or the faint of heart. At it's narrowest the canyon is merely 110 inches wide and even I, being 6 foot 9 inches tall and only weighing 180 pounds had trouble getting through the narrowest part. This canyon requires at least a 60 meter rope for the rappels.\n \nThe canyon can be divided into three sections. The upper section is fun to practice your down climbing, chimneying and stemming skills as the canyon isn't very deep but the bottom is a pain to walk directly on. The walls in the upper part concave nicely for easy canyoneering moves.\u00a0The middle portion is a mixture of very narrow slots and more open canyoneering. Many drops need to be down climbed or slid down in this section.\n \nThe last part is the most difficult and consists of a 150 foot section of extreme narrows where you'd better be very skinny or you aren't going to make it. The canyon dumps into Butler Wash with two 14 meter rappels into a pool of water where swimming can be avoided.

A large 25 foot drop appears but the rappelling anchor is located on the other side of a small ledge that is seen on the right side of the canyon.\u00a0You must belly crawl on this ledge as there is rock above you. Stay as close to the wall as you can and be sure you don't roll over and down into the drop to the left. Once on the other side of the ledge, you can set up the rappel and head down.\n\nShortly after this rappel is the extreme narrows that average 10 inches wide. I found myself in very strange positions getting through this part. The most memorable being twisted completely sideways with my knees on the ground and one hand on the ground leading me. The other  arm was positioned straight up and my head turned looking at the ground as I slithered through. \n\nIf you are over 200 pounds you will not make it unless you are over 6 feet and 6 inches tall however even at that height and taller, you'd probably want to be less than 200 pounds. You won't be able to just force yourself through this section. You'll have to scout around for the areas that are slightly wider and move up and down to those areas. Many times these are at the very bottom.\u00a0If you manage to get stuck, don't panic! Thats all I can say. If you are unable to make it through you'll have to backtrack which can be very hard to do as there was the rappel and belly crawl you came down.\n\n\n\nShenanigans Canyon NarrowsShenanigans Canyon NarrowsThis is the ledge you'll need to crawl on to get to the anchorAfter the extreme narrows, it widens slightly and eventually comes to the final two rappels where you will find slings around some chalkstones. The first can be down climbed by an experienced canyoneer but everyone will have to rappel the second drop. If you have a 60 meter rope you'll have to do the rappels separately as there is a 10 foot ledge between them.

Although it is possible to drive all 35 miles to the Halls Creek trailhead in a raging blizzard with no visibility with a foot of snow and flowing rivers on the road in a Subaru sedan car in March (That was quite an experience), DO NOT do it!!! When dry, any car can drive this road. Also, if you drive up the wash of Sheets Gulch a little bit, do not park in the wash. Find an elevated place to park.\n\nThe first rock formations seen upon entering the narrows\n\nSheets Gulch itself is a very long canyon (over 10 miles) as it cuts all the way through Capitol Reef so it's not likely you will want to go all the way up into Rainbow draw and Tantalus Flat and back.

However if you have two cars you can park one as described above and another on the other side of Capitol reef at Tantalus Flat and do a point to point hike.

{"Routes Overview": "This is meant to be an overview only.  For more details, and important co-ordinates and map references, see the ROUTE PAGE.\r\n\r\nFrom near pt. 6350, there is no one route, nor an easy way to describe a route. Prepare to get lost, at least for part of the time! There are several routes and you must follow the map carefully through the maze of drainages.  Notice the small drainage just northeast of point 6675. This is your route to the bench below. After reaching the bench, contour around the cliffs until you can follow the bench west and slightly north for over a mile to two little buttes which you will pass just north of at N38*43\u20197.005\u201d W111*1\u201930.130\u201d. After passing to the north of the buttes, contour south along a precarious route until you can descend into the canyon bottom. We found a place with only a 30\u2019 rappel.  Continue down canyon.  The slot has several 5th class drops, but we managed to down-climb all but the final 30 foot overhanging drop.  After a fairly easy and pleasant section, you will find yourself at the big drop of the canyon. The drop to the first drop of the two-tiered Bighorn Falls is 50m(165'), mostly overhanging and followed by an overhanging 9m (30') drop. After bighorn Falls are a few short falls that can be bypassed, and then hiking the canyon is fairly easy until the confluence with the West Fork.  The next section of the canyon is also spectacular and contains a nice surprise.  The final obstacle is a 15 foot rappel over a flowing waterfall (which may dry up at times).  Follow Gem Canyon down to Muddy Creek. There are fantastic erosional features.  When you reach Muddy Creek, head down stream. It is then a pretty easy walk down along Muddy Creek down to Tomsich Butte.  See the route page for a lot more detail. \r\n\r\nAfter completing the canyon there are four options.\r\n\r\nOption #1\r\n\r\nThe easiest option is to hike down Muddy Creek to Tomsich Butte, but as mentioned this requires a very long car shuttle.\r\n\r\nThere are two alternatives for those who don't want to do the long car shuttle, but it will take much planning and has special considerations. \r\n\r\nOption #2\r\n\r\n See this route page for details.  You could do the canyon as an over-night trip and hike up Muddy Creek and exit via Dizzy Trail Canyon and then hike back to the vehicle.  See the route description posted for this alternate route.  This will take two long days minimum (3 days may be better if you can pack very light).  The problem with doing an overnight trip is that the slot section of the canyon is so narrow that it will be very difficult to take an overnight pack through.  If you did attempt it, take as small as pack as possible (leave a tent and stove behind!) and expect some possible pack damage.  The only water available for camping is in Gem Canyon near Muddy Creek and possibly the grungy pool near Scorpion Falls.  Muddy Creek doesn't taste good, but could be used if you ran out of water (but treat the water!). \r\n\r\nOption #3:\r\n\r\nYou could also do the canyon and hike up Muddy Creek to Poncho Wash and exit via a steep exit chute.    This is the quickest way to do any of the entire Gem Canyon Forks without doing the very long car shuttle. \r\n\r\nDoing the entire Gem Canyon and looping via this exit route is a very long and tiring day. It took us over 12 hours, but we were really moving with few breaks.    See the Route Page.     The round trip distance is 17 miles and with the technical difficulties this makes for a very long day.\r\n\r\nOption #4:\r\n\r\nA final option is to backpack down Gem Canyon, hike up Muddy Creek to Lone Tree Crossing and exit.    Such a trip will take a minium of three days, but the car shuttle is much shorter than the one used by going down Muddy Creek to Tomsich Butte.\r\n\r\nDown-climbing a short 5th class pitch in the slot section.", "When To Climb": "The trailhead is not accessible between early December through late February in most years. Summer is extremely hot with temperatures exceeding 100F degrees (38C). Winter temperatures drop well below 0F (-18C). The best times of the year for this adventure are mid-March through May and then again in mid-September through mid-November. Muddy Creek can be very cold before April. There is some flash flood potential in the narrow sections, so have a good weather forecast before heading down the canyon. \r\n\r\nThis is a land of weather extremes. Temperatures in the nearest towns have ranged from -42F (-41C) to 112F (44.5C) at Green River and -35F( -37C) to 114F (46C) at Hanksville. On the day we went through the morning low was 29F (-2C) and the afternoon high was 86F (30C) in the shade. Sunny weather predominates and it only rains a few times a year, but when it does rain, it can really pour! Don't underestimate flash flood danger. \r\n\r\nSwiss cheese type rock in Gem Canyon.\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "There are several possibilities for starting the trip.  For simplicity, I will use the same description as the one for the West  Fork of Gem Canyon.  I must admit that last time I was there we missed the junction with the hill and cairn mentioned below and we were lost for a little while.  A GPS is highly recommended if not absolutely necessary.  The maps do not show the roads, but at least you will know where you are!      \r\n\r\nA journey to out in the middle of no-where............ \r\n\r\nUpper Trailhead\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, just finding the trailhead is a navigational challenge. You must do the vehicle shuttle the day before the trip as it will be a long day just getting through the canyon. You absolutely must have the 7.5 minute quads (maps) Big Bend Draw and Ireland Mesa for the drive to the trailhead. Even then, the maps are inaccurate especially near the trailhead. A 4wd is also required. The 63 mile shuttle took us 3.5 hours, but we already knew how to get there, having been to the head of the canyon before. Expect to take longer. \r\n\r\nTo get to the trailhead at the head of the canyon, drive west from Green River, or east of the Emery area along I-70 to exit 108. You must carefully follow the topo maps for the remainder of the drive. Take the southbound gravel road and veer right after a short distance. Stay on the main road until you reach Kimball Draw at an intersection with a sign. This is at about co-ordinates N38*47'16.47\" W111*5'52.69\". Turn left onto the dirt road signposted for Copper Globe. After following the bottom of the wash for a while, you will reach an intersection (no sign and it can be hard to spot) at about co-ordinates N38*47'4.42\" W111*4'34.19\". Turn right onto a seldom used track. Follow the track in and out of several drainages until you reach an intersection at a top of a hill at about co-ordinates N38*46'24.02\" W111*3'57.04\". Turn right here. \r\n\r\nThe road weaves in and out of drainages and scenic and colorful badlands and is one of the most interesting pieces of road construction I've ever seen. There are some sections of the road that pass through sparkling gypsum beds. Not too far after the road climbs out of Dizzy Trail Canyon (see the topo map), you will reach a junction next to a small hill with a cairn (pile of rocks) on top. From here on, the topo map is inaccurate as far as showing the many tracks go, so pay attention closely to the topographic features on the map. There are many routes to the trailhead, but here's the route we took. Turn right at the junction with the hill and cairn. You will cross a few very rough spots in the road while crossing two washes. After the second wash, make a very sharp left turn onto a track that heads east  [update: this track was just about invisible when we were here in 2007, so see the alternate route below]. The trailhead and where you're aiming for is very near the 6350 elevation marked on the Ireland Mesa quad NW of the word \"DIKE\" on the map. Park here. \r\n\r\nNote #1:  In 2004, I found an alternate route to the trailhead.   The road is not as rough from this alternate route, but the trailhead can be harder to recognize from this direction, as this route has no landmarks near the trailhead.  At the hill with the cairn, continue straight instead of right.   Look for a faint track to the right not far beyond the hill with the cairn.  This road leads to the trailhead, but it\u2019s hard to recognize.  Hopefully the cairn I left will still be there!\r\n\r\nNote #2:  The main track that continues left/straight from the junction mentioned in the paragraph above dead ends at Horizon Arch.   This is a scenic place and if you hike over the hill and slickrock, you will have an incredible view of the San Rafael Swell.\r\n\r\nThe trailhead is very hard to find. If the scene looks like this, you're close!\r\n\r\nExit Trailhead\r\n\r\nUnless looping out via Dizzy Trail Canyon or Poncho Wash, you must also leave a vehicle at the exit trailhead. You must also have a map to drive to this trailhead. Perhaps the best map is the Trails Illustrated-National Geographic Map San Rafael Swell. Another good map is the one in DeLormes Utah Atlas. Briefly put, you will exit I-70 at exit 131 and head south on gravel roads while following signs to Tomsich Butte and Muddy Creek. Most intersections are marked with signs. \r\n\r\nFrom exit 131 on I-70, follow the southbound gravel road. The road first heads west and then south. Stay on the main road at all junctions for the first 9.9 miles. At 9.9 miles turn right on the road marked Reds Canyon. Continue on the most used track to another junction at mile 13.5. This is a loop road and either fork will get you to the trailhead and both forks are about the same distance. Follow the road and map to Tomsich Butte. On the north side of Tomsich Butte, you will notice a faint track heading west. This is the best route to the trailhead. The track is a very rough 4wd track and you may prefer to walk. Follow the track west to its end. There is an old mining cabin near the end of the track. Park here. Notice your surroundings so you will recognize the place when you reach it on foot at the end of your trip. Hint: Notice the \"layer cake rocks\". \r\n\r\nMake sure to leave Green River or Castle Dale with a full tank of gas! This area certainly is out in the middle of no-where! \r\n\r\nNameless tower near the lower trailhead.", "Camping": "There are good campsites near both trailheads as well as many scattered throughout this region. the nearest official campground is many, many miles from this canyon. \r\n\r\nCamping in the canyon requires special preparation.

The beautiful Mt. Wilson Trail winds steeply up the west side of the canyon crossing over the head of the canyon before reaching the 5,715 foot summit of Mt. Wilson 7 miles from its start.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Looking down into Little Santa Anita Canyon from ridge on its west\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey in words the magnificence of this canyon.  Just one mile from the trailhead along the trail, the hiker encounters jaw-dropping views of the canyon scouring deep into the mountain.  Looking over the trail\u2019s edge to hundreds of feet of precipice below, it is hard to believe that you are not even at 3,000 feet elevation at this point.  Most times of the year, you can hear and see some of the many waterfalls that tumble down the canyon bottom.\r\n\r\nLooking down into Little Santa Anita Canyon the Mt. Wilson Trail can be seen center left\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mt. Wilson Trail is seen today in its modern guise, it has an ancient lineage.  Hundreds of years ago, and into the 19th century, it was a trail used by the Gabrielino Indians to access the San Gabriel Mountains and even beyond into the desert.  At one idyllic glen near the canyon bottom, now known as Orchard Camp, an acorn sprouted about 500 years ago right above the creek bed giving life to what is seen today as a giant oak tree.  For the hiker, Orchard Camp is a verdant and shady rest spot on the way to Mt. Wilson and that giant oak never fails to amaze.  \r\n\u00a0Mt. Wilson (5,715') is a popular destination on the Mt. Wilson Trail\r\n\r\nFor those wanting to move faster than the average hiker, the town of Sierra Madre sponsors each May the 8.6 mile Mt. Wilson Trail Race.  The race starts downtown, picks up the Mt. Wilson Trail at the trailhead, proceeds to Orchard Camp, and then back to the start.  A standard feature of the race is Sierra Madre Search and Rescue personnel on hand at the most exposed parts of the trail ready to deal with any mishaps.\r\n\r\nFinally, for those wanting to explore the canyon bottom, there is a convenient jumping off point about 1.5 miles into the canyon where a short detour from the main trail leads you down to the creek.  This spot is rightfully known as \u201cFirst Water,\u201d elevation 1,920 feet.  Descending the canyon from First Water garners an American Canyoneering Association rating of 3C III.  You will need appropriate canyoneering gear and will encounter about 8 rappels.

It is located on the Slateford Creek about 8 miles south of East Stroudsburg, PA. It is also located a few miles to the south of the Delaware Water Gap.\r\n\r\nWhen conditions are right, Slateford is a great place to climb. Even though the quarry is short, at most the cliffs are 60-70 ft high. It offers route from a WI2 waterfall, to a WI3 curtain, to WI4/5 pillars and some sweet looking mixed routes.  According to the mixed grade definitions in the Pennsylvania Ice Guide,  I would say that the mixed routes would be in the M3-M5 range. \r\n\r\nSlateford Falls is  U-shaped. The bottom of the U faces west and is where the waterfall plunges into the Quarry. The waterfall, when in, is WI2 and just over 15m tall. It can be led, but is usually soloed so topropes can be set up on either side of the quarry.  To the climbers right of the falls is the Slateford Curtain, WI3. Many individual pillars make up some very nice climbing. There is also a mixed line or 2 possible to the right of the curtain. To the climbers left of the falls are some short pillars that can be challenging. To the left of the pillars is the biggest wall in the quarry, and is home to 3 or 4 mixed lines that follow short pillars that lead to ice-less rock. To the left of the highest part of the wall, the end of the U bends out and there is another section of pillars that lead in to some more mixed ground.\r\n\r\n\u00a0", "Created/Edited": "Jan27,2009/Jan28,2009", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=40.94510&amp;distance_lon_9=-75.11950&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.94510\u00b0N/75.1195\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Winter", "Red Tape": "Slateford Quarry is located on National Park Service land and is located in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area.

{"Routes Overview": "The West Fork Route covers the descent of this canyon.  See the route page for details.  There are several obstacles including several 5th class down climbs and several raps of up to 200 feet.   After completing the canyon there are four options.\r\n\r\nOption #1\r\n\r\nThe easiest option is to hike down Muddy Creek to Tomsich Butte, but as mentioned this requires a very long car shuttle.\r\n\r\nThere are two alternatives for those who don't want to do the long car shuttle, but it will take much planning and has special considerations. \r\n\r\nOption #2\r\n\r\n See this route page for details.  You could do the canyon as an over-night trip and hike up Muddy Creek and exit via Dizzy Trail Canyon and then hike back to the vehicle.  See the route description posted for this alternate route.  This will take two long days minimum (3 days may be better if you can pack very light).  The problem with doing an overnight trip is that the slot section of the canyon is so narrow that it will be very difficult to take an overnight pack through.  If you did attempt it, take as small as pack as possible (leave a tent and stove behind!) and expect some possible pack damage.  The only water available for camping is in Gem Canyon near Muddy Creek and possibly the grungy pool near Scorpion Falls.  Muddy Creek doesn't taste good, but could be used if you ran out of water (but treat the water!). \r\n\r\nOption #3:\r\n\r\nYou could also do the canyon and hike up Muddy Creek to Poncho Wash and exit via a steep exit chute.    This is the quickest way to do any of the entire Gem Canyon Forks without doing the very long car shuttle. \r\n\r\nDoing the entire Gem Canyon and looping via this exit route is a very long and tiring day. It took us over 12 hours, but we were really moving with few breaks.    See the Route Page.   This route is 15-16 miles round trip and with the technical difficulties is a very long day.\r\n\r\nOption #4:\r\n\r\nA final option is to backpack down Gem Canyon, hike up Muddy Creek to Lone Tree Crossing and exit.    Such a trip will take a minium of three days, but the car shuttle is much shorter than the one used by going down Muddy Creek to Tomsich Butte.\r\n\r\n\r\nNegotiating the narrow slot section of the canyon.", "When To Climb": "The trailhead is not accessible between early December through late February in most years.  Summer is extremely hot with temperatures exceeding 100F degrees (38C).  Winter temperatures drop well below 0F (-18C).  The best times of the year for this adventure are mid-March through May and then again in mid-September through mid-November.  Muddy Creek can be very cold before April.  There is some flash flood potential in the narrow sections, so have a good weather forecast before heading down the canyon. \r\n\r\nThis is a land of weather extremes.  Temperatures in the nearest towns have ranged from -42F (-41C) to 112F (44.5C) at Green River and -35F (-37) to 114F (46C) at Hanksville.  On the day we went through the morning low was 13F (-11C) and the afternoon high was 79F (26C) in the shade.  Sunny weather predominates and it only rains a few times a year, but when it does rain, it can really pour!

Winters are cold and summers are hot.", "Getting There": "A journey to out in the middle of no-where............\r\n\r\nUpper Trailhead\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, just finding the trailhead is a navigational challenge.  You must do the vehicle shuttle the day before the trip as it will be a long day just getting through the canyon.  You absolutely must have the 7.5 minute quads (maps) Big Bend Draw and Ireland Mesa for the drive to the trailhead.  Even then, the maps are inaccurate especially near the trailhead.  A 4wd is also required.  The 63 mile shuttle took us 3.5 hours, but we already knew how to get there, having been to the head of the canyon before.  Expect to take longer.  \r\n\r\nTo get to the trailhead at the head of the canyon, drive west from Green River, or east of the Emery area along I-70 to exit 108.  You must carefully follow the topo maps for the remainder of the drive.  Take the southbound gravel road and veer right after a short distance.   Stay on the main road until you reach Kimball Draw at an intersection with a sign.  This is at about co-ordinates N38*47'16.47\" W111*5'52.69\".  Turn left onto the dirt road signposted for Copper Globe.  After following the bottom of the wash for a while, you will reach an intersection (no sign and it can be hard to spot) at about co-ordinates N38*47'4.42\" W111*4'34.19\".  Turn right onto a seldom used track.  Follow the track in and out of several drainages until you reach an intersection at a top of a hill at about co-ordinates N38*46'24.02\" W111*3'57.04\".  Turn right here. \r\n\r\nThe road weaves in and out of drainages and scenic and colorful badlands and is one of the most interesting pieces of road construction I've ever seen.  There are some sections of the road that pass through sparkling gypsum beds.  Not too far after the road climbs out of Dizzy Trail Canyon (see the topo map), you will reach a junction next to a small hill with a cairn (pile of rocks) on top.  From here on, the topo map is inaccurate as far as showing the many tracks go, so pay attention closely  to the topographic features on the map.  There are many routes to the trailhead, but here's the route we took.  Turn right at the junction with the hill and cairn.  You will cross a few very rough spots in the road while crossing two washes.  After the second wash, make a very sharp left turn onto a track that heads east [update:  this track was almost invisble in 2007, so you may want to use the alternate route below].  The trailhead and where you're aiming for is very near the 6350 elevation marked on the Ireland Mesa quad NW of the word \"DIKE\" on the map.  Park here.\r\n\r\nNote #1: In 2004, I found an alternate route to the trailhead. The road is not as rough from this alternate route, but the trailhead can be harder to recognize from this direction, as this route has no landmarks near the trailhead. At the hill with the cairn, continue straight instead of right. Look for a faint track to the right not far beyond the hill with the cairn. This road leads to the trailhead, but it\u2019s hard to recognize. Hopefully the cairn I left will still be there! \r\n\r\nNote #2: The main track that continues straight from the junction mentioned in the paragraph above dead ends at Horizon Arch. This is a scenic place and if you hike over the hill and slickrock, you will have an incredible view of the San Rafael Swell. \r\n\r\nThis is the Upper Trailhead out in the middle of no-where.\r\n\r\nExit Trailhead\r\n\r\nUnless looping out via Dizzy Trail Canyon or Poncho Wash, you must also leave a vehicle at the exit trailhead.    You must also have a map to drive to this trailhead.  Perhaps the best map is the Trails Illustrated-National Geographic Map San Rafael Swell.  Another good map is the one in DeLormes Utah Atlas.  Briefly put, you will exit I-70 at exit 131 and head south on gravel roads while following signs to Tomsich Butte and Muddy Creek.  Most intersections are marked with signs.\r\n\r\nFrom exit 131 on I-70,  follow the southbound gravel road.  The road first heads west and then south.  Stay on the main road at all junctions for the first 9.9 miles.  At 9.9 miles turn right on the road marked Reds Canyon.  Continue on the most used track to another junction at mile 13.5.  This is a loop road and either fork will get you to the trailhead and both forks are about the same distance.  Follow the road and map to Tomsich Butte.  On the north side of Tomsich Butte, you will notice a faint track heading west.  This is the best route to the trailhead.  The track is a very rough 4wd track and you may prefer to walk.  Follow the track west to its end.  There is an old mining cabin near the end of the track.  Park here.  Notice your surroundings so you will recognize the place when you reach it on foot at the end of your trip.  Hint:  Notice the \"layer cake rocks\".\r\n\r\nMake sure to leave Green River or Castle Dale with a full tank of gas!  This area certainly is out in the middle of no-where!\r\n\r\nAssuming you made it out of the canyon alive, you will end here at the exit trailhead.\r\n", "Camping": "There are good campsites near both trailheads as well as many scattered throughout this region.  the nearest official campground is many, many miles from this canyon.\r\n\r\nCamping in the canyon requires special preparation.  See  the route description. \r\n\r\nHuge ponderosa pines seek shelter and shade of the cliff wall.\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Little Gem Canyon is located is the San Rafael Swell in east central Utah.  There are three canyons in this complex, and this page describes the West Fork.  Click HERE to view the page on the Middle Fork.  These canyons are in the least touched and most isolated part of the San Rafael and is in one of the least explored regions of the United States. It is certainly the essence of the wild and unexplored.  The first recorded descent of this canyon did not occur until March 2003.  Only a handful of people have seen this spectacular and magnificent canyon.  Just to demonstrate how rugged this country is consider that the car shuttle between  63 miles consisting of mostly rough 4wd roads.  When looking at the map, notice that the straight line distance between the two trailheads was only two miles! It will take at least ten hours of hiking and four hours of driving to cover those two straight-line miles!  \r\n\r\nThis is an incredibly rugged technical adventure.  The trip is not for beginners.  Just finding the trailhead is a serious test of navigation.  Climbers and canyoneers should go well prepared before considering this trip.\r\n\r\nSteve Allen (author) coined the name \"Little Gem Canyon\" for this drainage because the canyon is a nice little hike of twenty minutes up from Muddy Creek, but there is much to be seen above the fartherest point that you can hike up from the bottom.  The canyon is huge above the drop and is laced with huge falls and geologic features, thus the name \"Little\" can be dropped.

Rushmore, The Devils Tower, Black Elk Peak (formerly Harney Peak), The Needles or other mountains and rocks.  But no trip to the Black Hills is complete without a visit to Spearfish Canyon, located on the northern edge of the hills.  Famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, when visiting Spearfish Canyon in 1935, observed of the canyon that it is \u201cunique and unparalleled elsewhere in our country\u201d.  He questioned \u201chow is it that I have heard so little of this miracle and we, toward the Atlantic, have heard so much of The Grand Canyon when this is even more miraculous.\u201d \r\n\r\nThe canyon rises nearly 2,000 feet from north to south. Highway 14A, which runs the length of the canyon, has many pullouts, allowing excellent access points throughout the canyon.  Since a majority of the canyon is on public land, most areas on both sides are open for exploration.  However, there are some private lands as well.  Adventurers need to respect the restrictions posted by private landowners. \r\n\r\nThe canyon is a regional favorite for hiking, climbing, biking and sightseeing. Spearfish Canyon is renowned for the fall colors each year.  The high limestone cliffs, along with various waterfalls, add much to the photo opportunities here.  The canyon and surrounding hills are full of aspen, birch, Ponderosa pines, spruce, oaks, and box elder trees.  Wildlife seen in the area includes mountain goats, deer, porcupines, raccoons, bobcats, and occasionally a mountain lion. Eagles are often seen floating down from the high walls of the canyon.\r\n\u00a0", "Geology & History": "\u00a0Bridal Veil Falls\u00a0Little Spearfish FallsThere are three distinct layers of limestone that make up the walls of the canyon.  The lowest level is Deadwood Sandstone, ranging from 10 to 400 feet thick. The middle level is comprised of Englewood Limestone, ranging from 30 to 60 feet thick.  The top level is comprised of Paha Sapa Limestone, laden with fossils, and usually from 300 to 600 feet thick. In some places, the canyon walls are over 1,000 feet high. The canyon also has igneous rock intrusions, most notable in places like Bridal Veil Falls.  \r\n\r\nRoughly 20 miles long, the canyon was carved by Spearfish Creek.  When one observes the small stream flow in some parts of the creek, it\u2019s puzzling how such a mighty canyon could have been carved out by it.  But, before mankind started reducing the stream flow, it was once known as the Spearfish River, the second largest stream to come out of the Black Hills.  The one major branch in the canyon follows the path of Little Spearfish Creek. There are other, small side branches, like the Iron Creek branch or the Eleventh Hour Gulch (so named because it is so steep that direct sunlight only gets in for about one hour a day).\r\n\r\nThe Spearfish Canyon area saw a huge influx of white settlers in 1876, during the Black Hills Gold Rush.  That same year, the city of Spearfish, located at the mouth of the canyon, was first formed.  A steam train route was built through the canyon in 1893, and operated until 1933, when a flood wiped it out.  The train line went out of business, and the old bed provided the base for Highway 14A. \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Oct20,2013/Oct30,2016", "How To Get There": "\u00a0\r\nSpearfish Canyon FoliageMost people access Spearfish Canyon from the city of Spearfish, located on Interstate 94, along the northern edge of the Black Hills.  \r\n\r\nOthers prefer to create a scenic route through the Black Hills, coming in from Deadwood and Lead by way of Highway 85, turning north at Cheyenne Crossing and entering the canyon on Highway 14A from the south.

If you venture off the regular trails, be it an unofficial trail or just bushwhacking, be sure someone knows your plan.  Some of the area is extremely rugged and hidden.  Being injured in one of the rarely-visited areas could prove disastrous.  The list and description of trails below is not exhaustive, but provides an overview of most of what is available.  The distances to these locations have the Highway 14A intersection with East Colorado Boulevard in Spearfish as the mileage reference point.\r\n\r\n76 Trail \u2013 This short \u00be mile trail quickly ascends 1,000 feet up the canyon wall to Buzzard\u2019s Roost, providing an excellent view of Spearfish Canyon and Little Spearfish Canyon.  The trailhead is at Savoy (13.2 miles from Spearfish), the junction points of Spearfish and Little Spearfish Creeks, as well as Highway 14A & Road 222 (the Roughlock Falls Road).\r\n\r\nSpearfish Canyon Floor Trail \u2013 The trailhead is behind the Spearfish Canyon Lodge at Savoy.  This short \u00be mile loop trail descends to Spearfish Falls.\r\n\r\nRoughlock Falls Trail \u2013 This trail starts near the Spearfish Canyon Lodge at Savoy.  It is an easy 1-mile trail to Roughlock Falls, and is also wheelchair accessible.\r\n\r\nRimrock Trail \u2013 There are upper (4.5 miles) and lower (3.5 miles) loops that share a common segment for a short distance.  Hiking just the outer parts of the two trails makes a 6.5 mile loop.  The trailhead for the lower loop is at the Rod and Gun Campground near Road 222 in Little Spearfish Canyon, while the trailhead for the upper loop is a couple miles further up the road at Timon Campground.  Timon Campground is also the trailhead for the Little Spearfish Trail.  Both loops have segments along Little Spearfish Creek and both have segments through forest areas.  The lower loop also ascends the canyon wall to the rim for some great views.  The upper loop ascends to over 6,000 feet and passes a junction with the Old Baldy Trail, an old ranger station, and an old rock quarry.  \r\n\r\nLittle Spearfish Trail - The trailhead for this 5.7 mile loop is also at Timon Campground.  The trail ascends to a maximum altitude of 6,280 feet, through a forested area usually well-populated by deer and elk.  Eventually, the trail drops to a route along Little Spearfish Creek and numerous small trout ponds.\r\n\r\nIron Creek Trail \u2013 This trail is out-and-back, 1.3 miles long.  A parking lot on the west side of Highway 14A is located about 11.5 miles into Spearfish Canyon, or 1.7 miles north of Savoy (Highway 14A & Road 222).  Follow the trail along Iron Creek and enjoy the rock formations. \r\n\r\nEleventh Hour Gulch \u2013 This very narrow side canyon is a local favorite, but finding a place to park could pose a problem.  The access is 9.4 miles into Spearfish Canyon along Highway 14A, 3.8 miles north of Savoy.  The short trail to the gulch (west side of road) could very easily be missed, with no signs marking it.  To go far into the canyon involves some climbing and very uneven rocky terrain. A small stream trickles through here.\r\n\r\nThe Devils Bathtub \u2013 This is another unmarked trail near Spearfish Creek.  About 8 miles up the canyon along Highway 14A, you will see \u201cCleopatra Place\u201d on the east side of the road.  Turn in there and park wherever you can find a place.  Cross the bridge and turn right, following the little creek (not Spearfish Creek) up stream for perhaps \u00be mile.  The stream has carved several swirled \u201cbowls\u201d along the route.  You will have to do some wading, so be prepared for that.\r\n\r\nEagle Cliffs Trails \u2013 This trail system is not in Spearfish Canyon, but is very close by. The trails are often used for cross country skiing, and also serve for hiking and mountain biking. The Eagle Cliffs trailhead is 8.4 miles southwest of Lead, SD along Highway 85.\r\n", "When to Hike or Climb": "\u00a0Autumn along the Iron Creek Trail\u00a0Autumn colors in Spearfish CanyonThe northern Black Hills receive substantially more snow than the rest of the hills.

At this split, turn left.

At almost 300 feet deep in places and up to a mile wide at times, it really does offer the type of elevation change not often seen in these generally flat areas. The area is home to large stands of hardwood and hemlock, as well as some open slopes along the gorge rim.

Outstanding narrows (really tight even for a small person), long rappels, and mind blowing scenery. You can combine it with a nearby canyon MMI. A good source of information is \"Moab Canyoneering\" Exploring Technical Canyons Around Moab by Derek Wolfe.\nThe canyon is dry - \u00a0no wading, swimming and therefore no wetsuits needed.\u00a0\nThe flood danger still exists, but lower than with other canyons.\u00a0\n", "Route": "\nLost and Found Canyon\nTight squeezesFrom the trailhead, follow the fence northwest on en established trail.

The canyon is wider here, not a slot, but still enjoyable, passing some slick rock section and some sandy sections.\u00a0\nSoon you will come to the first rappel, 12 meters (little over 40 feet) though a natural bridge. It is spectacular. The anchor for this drop is a single bolt high up on the right side of the canyon before the bridge. It can be tricky to spot per descriptions, but we had no problems finding it since someone has place a long blue webbing making this very obvious. The webbing was in excellent condition (April 2016). Pay attention not to hit your head when passing through the arch.\u00a0\nFrom the first rappel, a 5 minute walk finds you in a cave like room above the 2nd rappel. This one is about 23 meters, 76 feet. You land in a tight slot with a log, dry to make it on rappel on the way to the log. First members of the party can continue from the above anchor and rappel 12 more feet onto a better floor. The last person should either a down climb, or pull the rope down from the high anchor and sling it over a smooth log and rappel down. If you would go all the way down, there is a high chance of getting your rope stuck (you are at the point of no return, up climb is extremely hard and the next rappel is 130 feet!).\nThe canyon opens a bit in this section, before narrowing quickly again. These are the final tight narrows before the last rappel. It is very tight here and a bit awkward, first I tried to climb over, but you have to go down. This section may be really hard for large people. Very narrow chimney dropping you to the platform where the last long rappel is. There is a great view from the platform. The actors are solid here and very obvious. Rappel is 42 meters, 135 feet.

Climb on a slick rock bench, several cairn marked the route. You will encounter a few interesting moves here and there. You will be traversing on slick rock, some sections are very exposed and a fall here would lead to a serious injury/death.

One trip into the Wichita Mountain\u2019s Styx Canyon would remedy this misconception. Cutting through the heart of the Charon\u2019s Garden Wilderness, Styx Canyon is one of the remotest corners of an already remote corner of the Whichita Mountains. A lack of visitors in no way indicates a lack interesting features and beautiful scenery. On the contrary, this is one of the most striking parts of the Wichitas. The canyon has many of the best features that define the Charon\u2019s Garden Wilderness: high granite cliffs, massive granite boulders, lush meadows and small creeks and sweeping vistas that take in scenes both dramatic and far reaching. Though certainly not quite the same magnitude as the Elk Mountain area, this is still section of the Wichita Mountains that is extremely rugged, with the luster of seeing very few visitors pass through.\r\n\r\nStyx Canyon, not quite 1.5 miles in length, is the longest and largest canyon in the Charon\u2019s Garden Wilderness. The canyon has two very different portions. The upper canyon, beginning just over a ridge from the infamous Crab Eyes, extends about 0.6 miles to the southwest. This section of the canyon is very narrow and filled with massive truck sized boulders. This portion is similar to, albeit more ragged than, the Valley of Boulders that is traversed by the Charon\u2019s Garden Trail. The massive rocks make for interesting route finding and it is not uncommon to go a fair distance before coming to a 20 or 30 foot drop-off, often necessitating a bit of backtracking. Where the boulders do not choke the upper canyon, one finds small groves of post oak and juniper. Small tanks often fill these areas. Although it is not very deep at the canyon\u2019s headwall, by the time it passes beneath Twin Rocks Mountain upper Styx Canyon is about 400 feet deep, with high, sheer granite walls, particularly on the east side.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Upper Styx Canyon \r\nThe lower portion of Styx Canyon stands in stark contrast to the upper section of the canyon. Where the upper half was a narrow, boulder clogged fissure, the lower half is a broad, lush valley, nestled between the towering Twin Rocks and Granite Mountains on the east and Charon\u2019s Garden Mountain in the west. Unnamed, high granite walls complete the encirclement of this isolated vale. A small, seasonal creek drains the valley, flowing out into the farmland at the foot of the mountains. A few tanks are nestled into the grassy terrain. A fire burned through the Charon\u2019s Garden Wilderness in September 2011. Although its mark was left on parts of the upper canyon, lower Styx Canyon felt the conflagration\u2019s touch. Burned junipers and ghostly trunks offer testimony of the fire\u2019s presence. \r\n\r\nDespite the lack of human visitors, Styx Canyon still sees its share of bison, the nearly ubiquitous denizen of the Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge. The probabliity to see these giant beasts set against the backdrop of the tortured pink granite of the domes and crags is a thrilling prospect. Of course, the opportunity for climbing on the granite walls, particularly those at the north end of the lower canyon, and scrambling on the massive boulders is an additional inducement. However, the chief attraction of Styx Canyon is the chance to lose oneself in a seldom seen, beautiful landscape in the midst of the surrounding plains. \r\n", "Route": "\u00a0Upper Styx Canyon opening into lower Styx Canyon\r\nStyx Canyon can be approached from three directions. One can enter the lower canyon from the west, coming from Charon\u2019s Garden Mountain and from the east, climbing over Granite Mountain. The third approach is from the north, climbing over the ridge that stands just south of the Crab Eyes. The western approach is the longest and is most seldom used, simply because it is impractical. An epic loop covering much of the Charon\u2019s Garden Wilderness can be constructed by combining the northern and eastern approaches. This would include hiking to the Crab Eyes and then entering Styx Canyon at the north. After passing through the upper canyon and then hiking through the lower canyon, one then climbs over Granite Mountain, coming within feet of the summit, and easy deviation from the route. After descending the east side of the peak, one links up with the Charon\u2019s Garden Trail and returns to the trailhead.

{"Activities": "Hiking", "Getting There": "\u00a0start of the trail from the PostThe area can be accessed by 4WD via the Burr Trail from Boulder, but this description will focus on the approach from the north.  Turn south from Highway 24 onto the Notom-Bullfrog Road just east of the Park boundary, and follow this road until past where it reenters the Park.  It is advisable to check with Park personnel on the road conditions before your travel, especially if there have been recent storms.  In average conditions, the road is mostly smooth but has rattling washboard sections.  In bad conditions, even 4WD is not good enough.\r\n\r\nThe road passes the Cedar Mesa Campground not far past the Park boundary and continues south.  After some distance, it intersects the Burr Trail, and this is where it becomes up to you what to do.  Lower Muley Twist Canyon can be hiked all the way through from the Burr Trail as a multiday trip, or as two separate hikes, an upper section and a lower section.  Ascending the switchbacks of the Burr Trail over the Waterpocket Fold provides access to the top of the upper section of the canyon, while continuing south to the Post (or rather, to a spur road that leads a short distance past the Post to a trailhead with a toilet and a corral) provides the option of hiking up the upper section or of hiking the lower section as a day hike instead of a backpack (though strong hikers could do the entire canyon in a day as a 17-mile partial loop plus a shuttle).", "Camping": "Not far south past the Park boundary along the Notom road, there is a free \"primitive\" Park campground called Cedar Mesa with around half a dozen sites, a pit toilet, and picnic tables.

Little trace of this use of the canyon remains.\r\n\r\nThere are two trailheads; both are accessible by passenger car (except in bad conditions), and hikes from 6 to 24 miles or more in length are possible.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0peering out from inside one of the alcoves the stream has cut", "Created/Edited": "May1,2008/May31,2012", "External Links": "Capitol Reef National Park website\r\nNPS Lower Muley Twist Canyon page             \r\nWatch this page for the BLM to fix their Road Conditions link\r\n\r\nCapitol Reef climate sheet\r\nNWS 7-day forecast for near the Waterpocket Fold at 5000 ft elevation.

This is because there is a 2-mile \"Cut-off Trail\" that climbs over the Waterpocket Fold between the Post and a point in the canyon 4 miles south of the Burr Trail.  The Cut-off Trail is highly recommended, because the Waterpocket Fold is geologically fascinating and the views are excellent from on top.  The elevation change is also a welcome change of activity for the leg muscles given the miles of flat slogging involved in the rest of any of the routes.  Most published material warns of exposed scrambling on this part, but in my opinion this aspect is overrated.  At most there is easy class 2 with very mild exposure, and the route is very well-marked.\r\nWith a bicycle or car shuttle, a 6 mile hike between the Burr Trail and the Post via the Cut-off Trail (in either direction; which one is preferred depends whether you'd rather hike down or ride down, but if you have a car shuttle, you probably want to start from the top) is the shortest option other than an out-and-back from the Burr Trail that misses the best parts; for example there is a short section of narrows just before the Cut-off Trail is reached.

About halfway from the Cut-off to the southernmost point, the west side becomes more open and side canyons in the wall to the east are observed, which would be fun to explore (though perhaps difficult to squeeze into a day hike that is already at least 15 miles).  Later, the wall becomes continuously unbreached all the way to where the canyon takes a final turn to the east just past the confluence with a small, attractive tributary on the west, which is itself around a corner or two from probably the largest alcove, Cowboy Cove.  At this point you've walked about 9+ miles if you had started at the Post.  There is a section of narrows as it heads toward Grand Gulch, and then watch for cairns on the left marking the shortest way back to the Post (otherwise, the canyon empties into Halls Creek a little farther south).  From here it is a 5 mile walk more or less straight north back to the Post in an open valley on a trail popular with riders on horseback, for a total lower-loop (from the Post) distance of 15 miles, or 17 miles from the Burr Trail, not including a shuttle or extra 4+ mile hike.", "Red Tape": "Backpacking requires that you obtain a free backcountry permit from the Park visitors center (in Fruita along Highway 24) during its business hours, and except in official campgrounds you must camp 1/2 mile from any road.\r\n\r\nAlso, aside from the usual Leave No Trace, do not carry firearms, collect firewood, or build ground fires.

The metamorphic areas are generally found in the lower elevations while the granite dominates the high country.  Several small glaciers are found in the wilderness, notably on the slopes of Mt. Conness, Matterhorn Peak and Dunderberg.  The northern terminus of the wilderness area is near Sonora Pass, while the southern terminus is marked by Tioga Pass.  The Hoover Wilderness is the northern most wilderness area in the High Sierra, which is generally considered at an end at Matterhorn Peak, the northern most 12,000 foot peak in the Sierra Nevada.  The Hoover Wilderness includes the northern face of Matterhorn Peak. ", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0The upper falls in Lundy Canyon\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile there are many magnificent canyons along the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada, few present such awesome scenery in such an easily packaged bundle as found in Lundy Canyon.  Many of the best aspects of the Sierra Nevada are found here: soaring cliffs, rugged peaks, gorgeous meadows, riotous wildflowers, excellent waterfalls, and, once the Twenty Lakes Basin is reached, spectacular granite summits and glacial lakes.  All of this can be accessed with relative ease off of a major highway.  While such beauty has not gone unnoticed, Lundy Canyon is nonetheless relatively uncrowded, particularly by Yosemite (which is located only a few miles west of Lundy Canyon) standards.  Solitude is still a quality the characterizes the canyon, particularly if one travels off trail to Burro Lake, or once one begins the climb up to the Twenty Lakes Basin.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Lundy Canyon\r\n\r\nWhile many of Lundy Canyon\u2019s attractions are found in other parts of the Sierra Nevada, there are a few attributes that distinguish it from many of the more typical Sierra regions.  First, the walls of the canyon are composed of metamorphic rock rather than the granite that is a hallmark of the Sierra Nevada.  The cliffs are a colorful collage of reds, grays and blacks.  Another distinguishing characteristic of Lundy Canyon is the proliferation of aspens.  While these trees are found in pockets throughout the range, particularly in the Eastern Sierra, few places boast such an abundance of aspen trees.  These two attributes combine to give Lundy Canyon a feel that is in some ways resembles the San Juan range in Colorado more than the Sierra Nevada.  Nonetheless, when one climbs out of the canyon and enters into the Twenty Lakes Basin with its glaciers, glacial polished peaks and granite rimmed lakes, it is impossible to confuse which mountain range Lundy Canyon is found in.  \r\n\r\n\u00a0A beaver dam impounds Mill Creek in Lundy Canyon\r\n\r\nAnother unusual aspect of Lundy Canyon is the wildlife.  While all of the usual Sierra suspects are found here to varying degrees, the sizable presence of beavers is a noticeable departure from most Sierra wildlife communities.  The lower canyon has three massive beaver ponds that resemble lakes more than artificial bodies of water.  It is amazing to think that a very industrial rodent created these fake lakes.  Nonetheless, the presence of the beaver ponds does contribute to the beauty of Lundy Canyon, particularly since the canyon has no natural lakes beneath its walls.  Additional smaller beaver ponds are found further up the canyon in addition to the larger pools.  It is not unusual to find felled aspen trees with the traditional conical stump when hiking through Lundy Canyon.  It has been reported that the beavers are not native to the area but were introduced into the canyon.  Although this claim is unconfirmed, the beavers presence has certainly altered the appearence of Lundy Canyon by the development of the complex network of dams and the resultant ponds.\r\n\r\n\u00a0A major cataract on Mill Creek\r\n\r\nThree superlatives are usually used when describing Lundy Canyon.  Many say that the canyon has the Eastern Sierra\u2019s best waterfalls, wildflowers and fall color.  The abundant aspen and leaves little doubt that fall is a spectacular time in the canyon.  The numerous lush meadows host excellent wildflower displays, columbine being particular productive.  Lundy Canyon\u2019s waterfalls are some of the best in the Sierra.  Mill Creek, which forms the main waterway through the canyon, has two particularly large cataracts on it, one near the beginning of the trail and another near the point where the trail begins to climb out of the canyon.  Massive cascades tumble down the sides of the canyon as well.  The most notable of these is the outlet falls coming from Burro Lake, which is nestled in a high glacial cirque on the north side of the canyon and the falls the flows out of the Twenty Lakes Basin, near the western end of the canyon.  \r\n\r\nLundy Canyon was once the site of extensive mining activity.  The best evidence of this is found near the trailhead, where the ruins of a large structure and a pump are lost amid the dense aspens.  No trail leads to these ruins, but a bit of bushwhacking out of the southern side of the trailhead parking lot will lead to them.  An old cabin is found along the trail, in between the two primary falls on Mill Creek.  Even the name of the creek indicates the mining that once took place in the canyon.  Other mining ruins can be found around Oneida Lake, which is located in a massive cirque on the south side of the lower canyon.  Another important legacy of the canyon\u2019s mining history is the trail that leads from the canyon floor to the Twenty Lakes Basin.  \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jul10,2008/Jan27,2011", "External Links": "-Inyo National Forest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        ", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=38.01152&amp;distance_lon_9=-119.28183&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.01152\u00b0N/119.28183\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Summer,Fall", "When To Go": "Lundy Canyon\u2019s season is unfortunately short.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Mountaineering,Bouldering,Scrambling,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "\u00a0Lytle Creek Canyon\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get to the main fork of Lytle Creek is via paved road.  Take I-15 north of Rancho Cucamonga or south of Cajon Pass.  Exit Sierra Avenue and head north.  Sierra turns into Lytle Creek Road and you enter the canyon in just a mile or two.  Four miles up the canyon you will come to the Lytle Creek Ranger Station on the right-hand side of the road.  It is open 7-days-a-week from 8:00 am - 4:30 pm.  Stop in to see the animal exhibits, get information and permits, buy maps and books, and to stroll around the native plant garden in the back.  The flowers in it bloom in April and May and are lovely!\r\n\r\nAbout 6 miles up the canyon is the small community of Lytle Creek.  There is a post office, general store, restaurant, and an art gallery here.  Parts of this community are quiet and quaint, others are run-down and populated with rowdy people.  Apparently this is one of the hang-out spots for the Hell's Angels.   \r\n\r\nYou can also enter the main canyon via unpaved roads - the Swarthout Canyon Road links to Old Highway 66 near Cleghorn Road and Lost Lake or to Lone Pine Canyon Road near Mormon Rocks.  From here you can head up and over the Sheeps Canyon Road to Lytle Creek Road.  \u00a0Bonita Falls\r\n\r\nTo access the South Fork park about one mile above the Ranger Station near the sign for Green Mountain Ranch.  Here you will see the prominent South Fork Canyon intersecting the main canyon.  Cross the main stream and head west.  One attraction up this canyon is Bonita Falls which is the 2nd highest waterfall in Southern California.  In total its 4 tiers drop about 475 feet. Although only 3/4 miles from the road, Bonita Falls isn't what I would call an easy hike...  there isn't a maintained trail rather you make your way up a very rocky streambed dodging boulders and down trees and other obstacles.  Here and there you'll find bits of a user trail but I found it's easiest, and coolest, to just put on shorts or capris and a good pair of sandals like Keen's and just hike up through the water of the creek.  Even on a hot day you can stay relatively cool this way.  The last scramble up to the lower tier of the falls is the toughest but is worth it.  The waterfall is absolutely beautiful.  You can stand beneath it and get the most refreshing of nature's showers.  And then sit beside it a spell and watch the hummingbirds buzz around the flowers growing in nooks and crannies in the cliff.  Go Jan-May to see the best water flow.  But I would avoid crossing the stream and hiking in the canyon during flash-flood times.  \r\n\r\nTo access the Middle Fork about 2 miles above the Ranger Station turn left on Middle Fork Road.  This road is paved at first but quickly turns to a rough gravel road.  High clearance vehicles are recommended and 4wd isn't a bad idea, either, especially during the rainy (winter) season.  At the end of Middle Fork Drive is one of the main trailheads for the Cucamonga Wilderness.  If you hike up the Middle Fork Trail you will come to several backcountry camps and eventually Icehouse Saddle and Cucamonga Peak if you choose.  \r\n\r\nTo access the upper North Fork, just continue up Lytle Creek Road (3N06).  Near the firing range this paved road turns into a gravel/rock road (high-clearance recommended, and if the road surface is wet/snowy/icy then you'll need 4wd).  A few miles up this road Coldwater Canyon Road (3N06A) splits off from it going to the left, crossing the wash. Vehicles are not allowed to travel up and down the wash itself.  You will need high-clearance and 4wd to drive up to Coldwater Canyon.  A few more miles up 3N33 splits off to the right (road is currently closed due to the Sheep Fire, but when open climbs up to Gobbler's Knob).  Another mile or so and Paiute Canyon Road (3N06B) splits off to the right, again high-clearance and 4wd is required.  3N06 continues up to a camping area called Stockton Flats and eventually ends at a gate.  You can walk up the road behind the gate and reach Baldy Saddle at the Mt. Baldy Ski Resort.  \r\n\r\nLytle Creek area map\r\n", "Camping": "The nearest campground is Applewhite Campground.

The gorge follows the river through a primitive canyon on a well maintained trail. It is pretty when the sun shines but really comes into its own on those rainy cloudy days Oregon is famous for.   The boulders are covered with green moss; the trees are dripping with goat\u2019s beard and a dozen waterfalls cascade from the hillsides and on the river. For people from outside the area, it is a fantastically beautiful hike and on rainy day hikes to the falls will have you think you\u2019ll see Gandalf or Frodo around every turn.  It is a perfect example of  Oregon\u2019s rain forest and well worth the short drive from Eugene or a diversion from touring the coast.  \r\n\u00a0Trail along creek\r\n\r\nThe hike is popular even though it\u2019s a little bit of a drive from either Florence or Eugene. It\u2019s listed as one of the best easy hikes in Oregon on numerous websites and is reasonably simple to find.  You can expect small crowds on sunny days but the colder and rainier, the more likely you\u2019ll have the entire trail to yourself. \r\n\r\nThe hike is an out and back which starts from either of two trailheads. The Gorge (Homestead) trailhead is the longer and prettier hike.  Starting from the trailhead, the trail follows Sweet creek with a 350 foot   elevation gains past 11 waterfalls. Most of the waterfalls are small, no more than 20 feet high, but are pretty none the less.  The trail is well marked and well maintained for the entire length and suitable for casual hikers and non-hikers.  The trail gently climbs for the entire 1.1 mile of trails until it reaches an observation platform next to Sweet Water Falls.     \r\n\r\nThe main attractions, other than the gorge\u2019s stunning beauty are the 11 waterfalls.  The two biggest are Annice and the area\u2019s namesake, Sweet Water Falls.  Sweet Water Falls is a four tier fall and is 70 feet top to bottom.  There is a rustic observation point for the artistic and photographic next to the falls.  Of the remaining falls, they are much smaller but greatly add to the area\u2019s beauty.  During salmon spawning season, you can see the large fish fighting their way up the river and jumping up the waterfalls\u2026pretty spectacular. \r\n\r\nWeathermen in the area have the easiest job on the planet; all they have to do is predict rain and they\u2019ll be right over 2/3rds of the time. The area doesn\u2019t usually get serious snow in the winter or get very hot (over 80) in the summer.  First time visitors to Oregon, however, may find themselves chilled to the bone because of the damp even though the thermometer never falls below 45.  Don\u2019t let the moderate climate fool you\u2026bring a light jacket even in the summer. The locals tend to look washed out and pale due to little sunshine and few opportunities to tan. Overall, the climate is very similar to the Rhineland in Germany.   \r\n\r\nThe countryside is Douglas fir, Western Red Cedar, and Hemlock forest broken up by small farms (an acre or so) along the road.  In the canyon itself, the sheer walls along the gorge are lined with moss covered rocks.  This is raincoat, Sasquatch, and logger land.

Many people who happen across it are stunned by the scope of this very beautiful gorge.\r\n\r\nThe Tallulah River, which is the erosionary engine that has carved the place, has been dammed and otherwise diverted by the Georgia Power Company above the gorge, thus greatly reducing the volume of water that flows through Tallulah Gorge. The falls there, while still impressive, are but ghosts of their former power and appear by comparison to be merely trickles of the rapids and great waterfalls that greeted viewers early in the 20th century. \r\n\r\nMost of the gorge is now protected within the borders of the Tallulah Gorge State Park due to efforts by conservation groups and by the very large and powerful Georgia Power Company that had previously owned most of the land inside the gorge. The rim of the gorge is often very crowded, and it is difficult to find a place beyond the noise of motorcars and human voices.  Also, some development has occurred on the rim of the gorge in the form of roads, houses, and business, so that there is almost no chance for a wilderness experience there.\r\n\r\nHowever, the slopes and base of the gorge are well-protected by the state and one can find solitude and quiet 700 to 1000 feet below the lip of the rim.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=34.73800&amp;distance_lon_9=-83.38900&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">34.73800\u00b0N/83.389\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "Oct26,2005/Apr15,2007", "Red Tape": "If one is hiking merely the Rim Trail (north or south rim) and the Hurricane Falls Trail, then no permit is required.

And Mahoosuc Notch is largely level ground!\r\n\r\nThe Notch is a fine and grueling day hike in the Mahoosuc Range, or an obstacle course encountered by people hiking the length of the range.  Either way, it is well worth the conciderable effort.  \r\n\r\nSandwiched between Mahoosuc Mountain (a sub-peak of lofty Old Speck) and Fulling Mill Mountain, the Notch is threaded by a mile of trail winding through (litterally in many cases) huge piles of talus and boulders.  Deep below, a creek can be heard rumbling and booming in subterranean cavities, but it only becomes visible at the lower (eastern) end of the notch.\r\n", "Route Description": "Typically, Mahoosuc Notch is accessed via the Notch Trailhead on the Success Pond Road (see main page for directions).  Ascend an easy trail through northern pine and spruce forest for 2.8 miles to the top of the Notch.  The Appalachian Trail heads right and ascends steeply Fulling Mill Mountain on its march to Georgia.  Ahead, the trail descends slightly and heads east.  \r\n\r\nYour mission is a seemingly easier one.  However, looks are deceiving!  \r\n\r\n\u00a0Towering cliffs rise on either side of the Notch and have been shedding rocks of all sizes over millions of years.  Some of these rocks are the size of houses and they lie willy-nilly crammed into the narrow space of the Notch.  The stream which rises near the top of the Notch can be heard rumbling along through the rocks at an unknown depth.  The trail winds through this via the easiest route but the easiest route involves crawling under Winnebago sized granite boulders, stepping across mossy 20' deep chasms, scrambling up and down numerous 3rd-class drops, and traversing across steep rock slabs.  Some people regard it as fantastic fun while others view it with horror.  Getting through will take you at least an hour and a half.  It is possible to do with a fully loaded frame pack, but it is a definite challenge.  \r\n\r\nThe lower end of the Notch is a lovely glade where the stream finally emerges from the jumble of rocks and lies in a sandy, shallow bed.  Take a break here and rest your feet.  You're not done yet; you can either turn around and rethread the Notch, or continue up and over Mahoosuc Arm or even Old Speck itself.  \r\n\r\nThe ascent from the lower (eastern) end of the Notch is a grueling climb up steep, rough trail on the slopes of Mahoosuc Arm.  1.5 miles of this (watch your footing, wet rocks can be slippery) leaves you on the broad, open summit of Mahoosuc Arm.

For the Middle Fork, park just off the highway right past mile mark 9 a few feet after crossing the middle fork.

Park at this same cattle guard if you plan to hike down Lower Maidenwater Canyon.Lower Maidenwater Canyon HikeFrom the cattle guard, descend east off the highway down some loose talus and scree to the wash below and locate the long water tunnel heading under the highway. This is an awesome place to explore but make sure you have a headlight as there are some small potholes in the tunnel that you cannot see without one. Begin hiking down the sandy wash in the open canyon. About a quarter of the way down this 3 mile long canyon is a small drop-off that you can bypass on the left (north) side of the canyon. Just over halfway down is the first pool of water. There used to be a large chockstone here but in February 2013, it was gone and it was nothing more than a short wade. Once past this pool, the remainder of the canyon to Trachyte Creek has a little flowing water and very photogenic greenery. One short section has a beautiful subway narrows making for spectacular photos. When you get to Trachyte Creek you have two options. You can turn right and hike south for a half mile along Trachyte Creek and head west up lower Trail Canyon for 2.7 miles back to the Highway. This canyon is a very easy hike but doesn't have as many nice narrows and no water. The upper half gets very rocky as the wash is covered in large granite cobbles that have washed down from the Henry Mountains. If you take this route you will see new scenery on the return and keep your feet dry. Once you get back to the road you will have to complete the loop by hiking another half-mile north back to your car. This loop hike is nearly 7 miles long and makes a great day hike. The other option is returning back up lower Maidenwater Canyon and maybe you can spend some time exploring the North Fork on your way back. This hike is 6 miles long plus any extra you do for roaming around.\nScrambling back in after bypassing the drop\nLower Maidenwater Canyon Narrows\nLower Maidenwater Canyon Narrows\nLower Maidenwater Canyon Narrows\n\nSubway section\n\nStarting up Lower Trail Canyon\nNorth ForkParaphrased from Michael Kelsey:\u00a0\"From mile marker 8 on Highway 276, walk or drive east on the sandy track for 1.8 miles then hike east around the head of the norrth fork and route-find a way below the 15 foot Page Sandstone cliff. Continue southwestward into the slot which begins with a slide into a long pool. This shallow slot has 3 interesting descents and opens up to trees and brush at the end. Where the Little North Fork comes in from the left, after about a half-mile in the canyon, you can hike up steep slickrock and return back up to the rim. You could also hike the remainder of the North Fork down to where it meets Lower Maidenwater Canyon a short ways before Trachyte Creek.\"Note that I have not yet done the north fork so if anyone would like to contribute information or photos let me know and I will add it here! The north fork has a very short fun section with the remainder being an easy hike. I have heard it isn't too exciting. The middle and south forks described below are much more difficult with longer narrows and more technical canyoneering involved.Middle ForkThis canyon is a very fun 3 hour adventure and a great canyon for someone wanting to get an introduction to technical canyoneering. It's nearly always dry and offers a handful of easy to moderate difficulty descents. Park just south of mile marker 9 on the side of the road and hike southwest up to the rim of the canyon and hike 150 vertical feet up towards a small Carmel high point 0.2 miles from the highway. Just before reaching this highpoint, drop a few feet to the right and continue west in a small slickrock valley. Reach an awesome narrow ridge separating the Middle and South forks offering great views after 0.6 miles at 5,180 feel elevation. Continue west around the head of two side canyons and aim for the red colored tower clearly visible just to the northwest. Climb up 100 feet near the base of this tower and descend 200 feet into the open wash on the other side. This wash is the upper end of the Middle Fork. Begin hiking down the wash to the east. This approach hike takes about an hour.\nHiking up the rim of the Middle Fork just above the highway. Notice the red tower just above and right of the canyon.\n\nAim for this tower after rounding the two side canyonsContinue down the wash a short ways until you arrive at the big drop. Bypass this 50 foot drop by hiking around the rim to the south for a few minutes and scrambling down the 25 foot initial cliff band by using an undercling crack along a 45 degree friction slab (Class 4). Then you can walk a nice ledge back as it gently descends to the canyon floor. Continue down canyon and about a quarter of the way down you will come to a 30 foot drop with a sling wrapped around a chockstone buried in sand. Although this sling held our weight, we backed it up using a small tree just behind it. Just beyond is a section of six, 10 foot descents off chockstones, each having a small sling around them. I was able to descend each of these without using the rope however novices may want to either rappel or have a partner assist them. Each anchor looked decent in October, 2013 but always bring webbing in case floods damage existing anchors.\nLooking south at the first big drop\n\nMiddle Fork\n\nPhotogenic section\nAfter the six chockstone drops, the canyon eases up a bit and you go through a photogenic hike through section. Near the end as you get close to the highway, there are two more drops each about 8 feet where you can slide down a slab and land on soft sand. There were no anchors on either of these drops so beginners may need someone to spot them from below. At the end of the canyon you will arrive at the tunnel that was drilled to allow water to flow freely under the road. With a head lamp you can hike through the tunnel, but you can easily hike up loose talus and scree on either side for 50 feet or so to reach the road. For the Middle Fork, bring a 15 meter rope, rappelling gear and a handful of 10-15 foot slings.\nGoing down one of the 8 foot slides\n\nEnd of the middle fork...highway is just above\nSouth ForkThe south fork is the best and most difficult slot in the Maidenwater Canyon drainage. It typically has a few standing water sections that can be anywhere from ankle to waist deep and numerous descents between 6-12 feet. Most of the drops had webbing wrapped around chockstones and we decided to use them on a few of the drops. Begin this slot by parking next to the cattle guard at mile 9.4 in the highway at a big pull-off. Hike west up an easy slope just north of the South Fork and reach the rim. Follow the contact between the white colored Navajo Sandstone and the reddish Carmel Formation for about a mile. Along the way you will hike around a major side canyon that ends in the south fork shortly before the highway. On your way down the canyon, you will know you are almost finished when you pass the open area where this side canyon ends. As you hike along the Navajo-Carmel contact, you will gain elevation gradually following this ledge and pass very close to the ridge you hike across for the Middle Fork. There is no need to climb up to this ridge unless you want to see the view. Stay 20 feet below it and follow the contact until you get to the point where you can see the end of the south fork, then scramble 20 feet up to the Carmel rim. Do not continue on the Navajo Sandstone the final half-mile as the terrain steepens. Locate a small boot path and easily hike to the head of the south fork where you will find a 25 meter drop.\nApproaching the South Fork\n\nLooking up the side canyon from the rim above\n\nNearing the head of the south fork\nYou can make the rappel down this big drop if you have a 50 meter rope, otherwise continue around the head of the South Fork for a few hundred feet and descend into the drainage via a short blocky scramble, a small slickrock slide onto a ledge, then hike back on the ledge as it descends to the canyon floor near the base of the 25 meter drop. You do not need to do this first rappel and it's recommended you bypass it because carrying a 50 meter rope through this canyon would be annoying and only complicate things. Continue down the canyon which is open at first but quickly gets down to business. There are at least 15 descents each having about a 10-15 foot drop and many of them into small potholes of water filled with mud in the lower half of the canyon. I believe I saw webbing on every single drop that wasn't an easy scramble. I rappelled 5 of the drops where the canyon was too wide to chimney down and was able to simple grab the webbing with my hand to get started on a handful of others. About halfway down, there is a 15 foot drop into a pool that you will have to rappel into off a chockstone. This pool is not the permanent one Kelsey refers to in his book but it was about knee deep in October, 2013. Just beyond this is another 15 foot drop into a permanent pool with a long piece of webbing with a bunch of knots tied in it to use as a hand-line. This pool is typically knee to waist deep that you will have to wade through.\nAt the head of the south fork...scramble in on the right side\n\nLooking back at the 25 meter drop\n\nThe first pool we encountered\n\nDescending one of the many drops\n\nPhotogenic section\n\nStemming over more water\nDepending on how recently it rained or if there is still snow in the Henry Mountains, this will only be the beginning of many small wading sections for the second half of the canyon. Sandals would be an awesome idea for this one as we spent a crazy amount of time taking our shoes off and putting them back on over and over again. I would bet this canyon typically has many small pools unless it has been very dry for a long period of time. The deepest pool we encountered was slightly deeper than waist deep. Plan on being in this canyon for at least 5 hours. Just past the open area where the side canyon comes in from the left (north) there is one final slide into a deeper pothole that is probably filled with water followed by the final rappel which is a 20 foot drop with webbing wrapped around a huge rock. This last obstacle is 100 feet from the highway and can be bypassed by climbing up steep slickrock slabs to the left about 30 feet and walking the ledge down to the tunnel. Don't hike through the tunnel without a headlight but you can hike up loose talus to the highway from either side.\nOne of the rappels\n\nGlowing light in the South Fork\n\nA tree in the south fork\nSouth Fork Video Clip\nLower Maidenwater Canyon\n\n", "Overview": "\n            Maidenwater Canyon is a fairly major drainage system in the extreme southern section of the Robbers Roost Country which drains into Trachyte Creek from the west. These canyons, along with Trail Canyon just to the south drain the eastern flank of Mount Pennell and Mount Hillers in the southern Henry Mountains. Therefore, these canyons typically have more water in them especially during the spring snow melt. Maidenwater offers fun, technical upper forks to the west of Highway 276 and a pleasant and beautiful non-technical hike through lower section to the east of the highway. There are three technical upper forks, the North, Middle and South all of which have fun downclimbing sections, pothole wading and short rappells.

It encompasses 36,113 acres of rugged canyons and plateaus in the Book Cliffs about eight miles north of Grand Junction. About 150 wild horses roam the sagebrush parks and pinyon-jupiter covered hills. Natural carries such as cliffs and canyons are supplemented with fencing to define the area and control horse movement.\u00a0\nWho brought horses to America? some say that present day wild horses are derived from Spanish explorers, but during the Ice Age the ancestors of the modern horse roamed the North American continent. They were smaller than the horses today and became extinct over 10,000 years ago. Horses were reintroduced to the continent in the 1500s by the Spaniards who explored and began to settle what is now the western United States.

At the exit, turn north and cross a bridge over some railroad tracks to a four-way blinking red light. Turn left. Go 1.2 through downtown New Castle and turn right onto N. 7th Street. If you cross the creek you have gone just a little too far. Follow this road for .7 miles through a neighborhood and continue straight at the junction with Castle Valley Boulevard. After another 3.1 miles turn right onto CR 243 (Main Elk Road) which is paved. Follow this road for 6 miles until it crosses the  creek and reaches a trailhead and a small parking area. ", "Camping": "Camping is illegal at the trailhead for the Main Elk area. My recommendation would be to either stay at the nearby Elk Creek Campground (just up nearby East Elk Creek) for a small fee, or backpack a short ways into Main Elk Canyon (being sure to adhere to No Trace ethic, of course).", "Hiking": "Two major hiking trails exist in the Main Elk Canyon system: the trail that follows the creek into the canyon proper, and the steeper, Hadley Gulch trail that turns away from the creek and follows Hadley Gulch up to the canyon rim and, ultimately, onto the Flat Tops.\r\n\r\nFrom the parking area, follow the Hadley Gulch trail for .22 miles until you reach a prominent fork. Here is where the two routes differ:\r\n\r\nHadley Gulch Trail- The right branch at the fork contours steeply up the hillside and into the steep, usually dry, creekbed. In the spring, however, this creek can have a substantial amount of water and be difficult to cross (as was the case for several weeks during the banner year of 2011). A small side-trail on the left just after the creek crossing accesses the Pup Tent climbing area. The first route, Gatehouse of Lonliness, is the black buttress right at the junction. \r\n\r\nTo continue up the Hadley Gulch trail, follow the steep and winding trail as it climbs past the Fortress of Solitude (about a mile passed the creek crossing and hard to miss) and into a meadow where there is another fork in the trail. You can go straight and follow the creek, but the route quickly becomes overgrown with many downed trees. The main trail turns left and climbs up the hillside to a notch in the cliffs. Here you can get on the plateau above the canyon where some indistinct dirt roads navigate around the canyon rim. From here you are about 2.75 from the trailhead and have gained over 2,000 feet of elevation.\r\n\r\nOn top, there are a number of options available by following any of a number variety of backcountry roads. This is a barren place that doesn\u2019t see much traffic.

This beautiful trail follows Main Elk Creek along the bottom of a narrow, quaint canyon for two miles to a prominent fork. There is possible camping in this area. The trail peters out here and navigation becomes more difficult. To continue farther you will need good backcountry skills. Ultimately, if you follow this canyon to its source, you will emerge deep in the Flat Tops above the Crater Lake.\r\n\r\n[img:712886:aligncenter:medium:Main Elk Creek ]  [img:747766:aligncenter:medium:Campsite up Main Elk ]\r\n", "Overview": "\n            Main Elk Canyon is one of the major creek basins that drains the southwestern portion of the Flat Tops Range in central Colorado. This major canyon is home to some remote alpine terrain, soaring limestone cliffs, and some of the best sport climbing in western Colorado. The creek, accessed from the small, non-descript town of New Castle, Colorado, also has a pair of significant trails that can lead one eventually into the Flat Tops Wilderness Area. \r\n\r\nThe Main Elk area is one of western Colorado's most beautiful and least traveled places. It's semi-remote location and out-of-the-way approach have deterred many people. For those, however, that are willing to spend the time to seek out what lies within this amazing place, there are untold secrets just waiting to be discovered. The possibilities for future rock climbing seems almost limitless, and the possibility for adventure is there for those willing to put in the work. While the Pup Tent of Solitude and Main Elk crags offer only mediocre to moderate challenges, for the sport climbing master with a sense of adventure the Fortress of Solitude is one of the best climbing destinations around.\r\n\r\n[img:712886:aligncenter:small:][img:747769:aligncenter:small:][img:747796:aligncenter:small:] [img:747772:aligncenter:small:]   ", "Created/Edited": "Sep20,2011/Sep24,2012", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=39.68513&amp;distance_lon_9=-107.58113&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">39.68513\u00b0N/107.58113\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Main Elk offers various sorts of adventures in all seasons.

Hiking within the shady canyon is quite pleasant in the hottest part of the summer season. In the spring, Main Elk Creek can be very swift, and the canyon's narrowest point is often flooded at peak runoff, making for difficult passage.\r\n\r\n[img:747796:aligncenter:medium:Winter in Main Elk] [img:747813:aligncenter:medium:High water]", "Climbing": "While the climbing in Main Elk Canyon will never be as popular and famous as nearby Rifle Mountain Park, there is some climbing here that is without-a-doubt world class.

", "History": "[img:720251:alignleft:medium:Hadley Gulch just off Main Elk Canyon]\r\n\r\nThe Main Elk drainage has mostly escaped the popularity that has engulfed the neighboring creeks and trails of Glenwood Canyon, yet from a climbing perspective this area is far more significant to the annals of rock history. \r\n\r\nIt could be said that without the attention gained by the hardwork of Tommy Caldwell in 1999 and 2003, the Fortress of Solitude would be just another obscure, if massive and untapped, crag in the Colorado backcountry. When Caldwell redpointed Kryptonite in 1999, it was the country\u2019s first 5.14d, making the moment a benchmark in the history of American sport climbing. Due to subsequent changes in the route topography, perhaps due to natural processes or perhaps due to clandestine chipping by later climbers, Kryptonite is often now considered 5.14c. \r\n\r\nNearly four years later, Caldwell returned to the Fortress and redpointed a monster project he eventually named Flex Luthor after several months of work. Famously, Caldwell refused to rate the route, claiming only that it was \"significantly harder\" than Kryptonite, which led climbing media to claim Luthor as the first 5.15. To this day the route's rating has yet to have confirmation as nobody has been able to repeat Caldwell\u2019s climb.\r\n\r\nLater development by climbers such as Dave Pegg, Matt Samet, Bryan Gall, Jeff Achey and others have greatly expanded the climbing at the Fortress and Pup Tent areas. Other walls nearby, including some cliffs on the northeast side of the road, are also starting to be developed, though information about these routes is difficult to obtain.\r\n", "Location": "Colorado,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},
{"Essential Gear": "Most parties use a rope in descending the canyon. If you are comfortable soloing class 4 rock, you should have no trouble in Tenaya Canyon. If you are ascending and want to bring a rope, be sure to have at least one good climber in your group - the slabs are not easily protectable for an ascent, and someone will likely have to solo the four sections to set up a rope for the rest of the party. \r\n                     ", "Overview": "\n            Tenaya Canyon is one of the classic scrambles in the vicinity of Yosemite Valley. The official NPS map given out to visitors at the park entrance has a specific warning in the center of the map stating: Hiking in Tenaya Canyon is dangerous and not recommended.. They may as well just say \"Free beer and pizza\" if they are directing their warning to the curious scrambler. \r\n\r\nMake no mistake the route is a serious undertaking, but it can be rather fun too. It should only be attempted in late summer or early autumn when water levels are low enough. At times of high water the route is considerably more dangerous. Route-finding is somewhat tricky. Most parties seem to either do the descent in a day, or take two days to do the ascent. The fastest parties can make it in both directions in a single day, but be sure you have sufficient stamina and confidence in your solo skills if attempting both directions.\r\n\r\nThe length of the route from the Mirror Lake TH to Tenaya Lake is about 10 miles, all but about three miles is cross-country and much of this fairly rugged. Most parties take 7-8 hours when descending the canyon using rappels which take time to set up and execute (there are four bolted rappel points in the canyon). The canyon was annually descended from 1909 to 1937 by one S.L. Foster. Today there are perhaps a dozen or two (mostly) descents each year during the 1-2 month low water period (Sept-Oct). \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Feb24,2004/Oct3,2006", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=37.74000&amp;distance_lon_9=-119.58000&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.74000\u00b0N/119.58\u00b0W</a>", "Route Description": "Tenya Canyon can be broken up into roughly four sections, each described here. Route-finding is somewhat different depending on whether you are heading up or down the canyon. An attempt is made here to describe both directions, but be aware that no amount of text will substitute for route-finding skills. The descriptions here may be very helpful or completely useless depending on the party and their individual experience. It is a good idea to have a backup plan in case you run into trouble, namely returning the way you came. Don't put yourself into the position of forcing your party to continue ahead against your better judgement.\r\n\r\nLower Gorge\r\n\r\nThis is the section between the Mirror Lake trail and the Inner Gorge. In general it is an easy (class 2) section with tricky route-finding only at the beginning (west end). From the bridge at the end of the maintained trail, there are use trails leading off on both the northwest and southeast sides of Tenaya Creek. The trail on the southeast side is harder and will disappear in about 1/4 mile. From here you have two options. If you follow the creek directly (on the southeast side), you will soon come to a beautiful 30-foot waterfall. Following the creek to the right of this is class 3 with low water, slippery class 4 with just a little bit more water. There are huge boulders and just figuring out how to get around this is an interesting challenge. Your second option is to head southeast where the use trail ended, following a dry side creek up about 150ft. Another use trail then heads east across some easy slabs to the top of the waterfall section described above. This second option is far more obvious during a descent than an ascent. This entire first challenge can be bypassed if you start on the northwest side of the creek from the beginning at the bridge. A use trail is found that traverses roughly 50-100 feet above the creek level across leaf-strewn slopes under shady oaks. Though less interesting, this is by far the fastest option and can easily save half an hour's time, possibly more. The use trail gives out about halfway up the Lower Gorge and leaves you off in the flatter upper section walking up the broad, boulder-strewn creekbed. There is little elevation gain for the last mile in the Lower Gorge, and the hiking is easy, if tedious. There are excellent views of Half Dome, Clouds Rest, and Watkins Pinnacle to enthrall you. Eventually the canyon will narrow to little more than 50 feet across, and it will be obvious you have reached the Inner Gorge. If descending, keep an eye out for the use trail on the right (northwest) side about halfway down this section where the angle of descent starts to pick up again. If you don't find the use trail it is not critical. You should have less trouble than you found making your way through the Inner Gorge.\r\n\r\nThe Inner Gorge\r\n\r\nThis is the most interesting section of the entire route. The walls close in steeply on two sides, almost claustrophobically, and there is little sun that penetrates to the creek level. Consequently, one will find unusual fern gardens and delightful pools (some with decent-sized fish in them) to dazzle your senses. The scrambling is highly varied - large boulders, polished granite, a little bushwhacking at times,  some optional rappels. Published descriptions of this section vary widely, which mainly shows that there are many options, so I will describe it in general terms only. Besides, route-finding for yourself is a good deal of the fun to be had here. There are four fixed rappel anchors, all of them located on the northwest side of the stream. Since these are generally only used for descents, they are numbered starting with the one furthest upstream. The first is located just above the top of the Inner Gorge, on some ledges about 80-100ft above the creek. If coming from Lost Valley above, it is pretty obvious when easy progress is stopped by a cascading watercourse down into the gorge. Look for the ledges to your right and the anchor further down amongst the ledges. Anchors #2-4 are located further down, #3 & #4 are closer together and about a hundred yards from the bottom of the gorge. Some parties report only finding or using 2 of the rappels, so clearly they are not all necessary. \r\nMost of the time, it is never necessary to climb more than about 50 feet above the creek on one side or the other to bypass obstacles. It should never be necessary to climb up the streambed directly except for one section lower down, just below anchor #4. At the top of the gorge, one encounters an impasse if following the creek directly. Steep walls surround you, and you can see the trees of Lost Valley tantalizingly out of reach above of you. A fractured, near-vertical mossy wall on your left is the descent route from anchor #1 above. The wall might go at 5.8 or 5.9, but it looks dangerously slick and unstable. Regular humans must backtrack about 100 yards down the canyon and choose a route high up to the left or right. Most parties report using the northwest side, a steep talus climb with some bushwhacking followed by some traversing ledges about 200 feet above the creek. It is also possible to climb about 300 feet up on the southeast side, followed by some bushwhacking and then class 3 slabs to reach Lost Valley.\r\n\r\nLost Valley\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas of finding an enchanting forested valley in a remote locale, perhaps lured by the name, forget it. There's really very little that is enticing. It is often hot and exposed, the thin forest understory thick with reeds and brush. We didn't see anything that might make a decent camping spot. Mostly you just want to get through it. The lower part is easy, just follow the valley floor not far from the creek on whichever side seems less difficult. The upper part is a bit tricky. The key thing to remember is that you do not follow the granite slabs on either side of Pywiack Cascade (where the main flow of Tenaya Creek follows). The upper section is too slick and steep. The correct route is about a quarter mile to the south, up (or down if descending) some incredibly steep slabs about 800 feet in elevation that look impossible to climb without a rope and almost certain death. Once on them, you find the angle is not so steep and even tennis shoes will grip fairly well - but the height will play tricks with your head if you lose confidence. From below we watched a party of 10 (with quite a few novices) descend without mishap, though not without apprehension. Finding this route from below is pretty easy as you have to go out of your way to continue upstream to Pywiack Cascade. The wide open bowl is pretty obvious rising over 800 feet up on your right. From above, it is not so easy. From the top of Pywiack Cascade, head southwest up slabs aiming for a rounded boulder-strewn ridge. Perched atop is an unusually spherical rock some 15 feet in diameter that makes an excellent landmark (and a good bouldering challenge). Continue southwest, descending talus and a bit of bushwhacking until you find the top of the bowl marking the 800-foot slab descent. The south side of the slabs offers the easier route, particularly in the lower reaches where it will help you avoid the often slick rock where the water is trickling down from above.\r\n\r\nGlacial Valley\r\n\r\nThis is the name given by S.L. Foster to the hanging valley above Pywiack Cascade. It is about two miles in length, has a gentle grade, and makes for easy class 1-2 walking. The upper end of the valley offers the only challenge, where the creek runs mostly north-south, cascading down a wide granite bowl about 300 feet high. Parties have reported climbing the granite slabs on either side of the creek, so choose what looks easiest to your party. These are far less steep than the slabs bypassing Pywiack Cacade at the head of Lost Valley. At the top of the bowl you should find yourself at Admonition Point - the rest is an easy mile walk out to find the trail and then another half mile to Tenaya Lake.\r\n", "Approach": "If descending from Tenaya Lake, the closest parking is at the Sunset TH just west of the lake. Overnight parking is allowed here. Follow the Forsyth trail southwest for about half a mile until shortly after it has headed in a southeast direction and begins a short climb. Leave the trail, cross to the northwest side of the creek, and continue downstream. At the start, you should be heading in a direction almost due south. Follow the easy streambed (often dry in Sept-Oct) for a mile until you reach the top of a large granite bowl leading down to Glacial Valley. This point has become known as Admonition Point due to the rustic NPS sign found here warning visitors to stay out of Tenaya Canyon. You have reached the start of the route.\r\n\r\nIf ascending from Yosemite Valley, the closest parking is at the stables, but be aware that overnight parking is not allowed here. Overnight parking can be found at the JMT backpackers lot located between Curry Village and Happy Isle. The free shuttle bus can drop you off even closer at the the Mirror Lake TH, but the bus doesn't usually run early enough for most parties. From the Mirror Lake TH, head east for several miles to the end of the maintained trails. There are trails on both the north and south side of Tenaya Creek (either can be followed), both ending where they join at a bridge crossing the creek on the far east end. This is where the Tenaya Canyon route starts.\r\n", "Location": "California,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

{"Activities": "Canyoneering", "Mountain Conditions": "As any mountain location, Matacanes weather can change in a snap. Summers are usually very hot, with temperatures climbing into the 100's. All it takes is an overcast sky and a brief shower to drop temperatures to the 50's. The canyon can take light rains without swelling a lot. Heavy rains though, are another issue. That's why the Civilian Protection guys are always there. If they are notified that the water level is getting too high, the access to Matacanes is denied.\r\n", "Getting There": "Almost all the groups leaving for Matacanes start from Monterrey, the state of Nuevo Leon's capital. A big, industrial city, 3 million in population. You take what is known as Vieja Carretera Nacional, or Old National Highway, Southbound toward the small city of El Cercado. There, you will see signs pointing to the right (West), to a place named Cascada Cola de Caballo, Horse Tail Waterfalls, a very well known, touristic attraction. There, a first class hotel of the same name is the other point of reunion for the groups going to Matacanes. Usually, if you are going with a company that catters to climbers/canyoneers (your best bet), this will be the meeting place. From here, 4X4 trucks will take you for a 15 minutes ride to a place called Puerto Genovevo. Here you leave the paved road, you turn sharply to the left into a dirt road, and start a steep descent into a huge, pined choked canyon. After about an hour and a half, depending of course on climatic conditions, you will arrive to a place called Las Adjuntas, a group of sheds and some cabins by the river. This place is the end of Matacanes circuit. The trucks keep going on for another hour, now climbing up a twisted, narrow, carved-in-the-mountain dirt road toward Potrero Redondo.This is another place with five or six sheds and cabins, where many of the parties start donning their long lycras, neoprene suits, helmets, harnesses, PFD's etc, and start walking uphill. Another hour of climbing will take you to the top of a waterfall and the beginning of Matacanes canyon descent.\r\n", "Camping": "If you drive yourself all the way to Las Adjuntas, you may park your truck and camp there for a very modest price.

Matacanes is both a climbing an a canyoneering experience, one that will put your stamina to the test. Without you knowing of course. This inocent, one day trip, starts getting some respect after the first two hours of exposure to the canyon's crystal clear, cold water, and the slippery, ankle-twisting boulders you have to negotiate on your way down. After four hours, a 80 feet rappel by a waterfall, another rappel into a huge cave with an interior lake, more cold water, and the notion that you are only half way into the canyon, Matacanes gets your undivided attention.\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=25.33223&amp;distance_lon_9=-100.34706&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">25.33223\u00b0N/100.34706\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "Jul19,2002/Dec24,2008", "Miscellaneous Info": "There are many  companies that can take you to Matacanes for a reasonable fee.

To the east is the Pueblo de Cochiti Indian Reservation, and on the western side, the Jemez Mountains.  Kasha-Katuwe means 'white cliffs' in the Keresan language of the Cochiti tribe.\n\nTent Rock Hoodoos\n\nTent Rocks Canyon is a rare New Mexico slot carved in 1,000 feet of ash, tuff and pumice of volcanic activity.  Found in the canyon are small rounded balls of obsidian (volcanic glass...also known as 'Apache Tears') which are further evidence of the mighty geologic forces that have shaped this area.  The Tent Rock Hoodoos themselves are made of the soft tuff but capped with slightly harder rock which allows erosion to happen on the perimeter, but prevents erosion in the center.  Some of the cones have lost their caprock and are now starting to erode away.  The combination of soft tuff and flash floods have carved this spectacular slot. \u00a0\n\nThe White Cliffs\nEntering the CanyonThe National Monument comprises just over 4,000 acres, ranges in elevation from 5,570 to 6,760 feet, and includes a national recreational trail with two segments.  The Cave Loop Trail is a 1.2 mile loop.  The Canyon Trail is 3 miles round-trip and ascends the Canyon to the Mesa Top for an elevation gain of 630 feet.  Both trails are maintained and start at the parking lot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nSlit of Sky\nThe Dance of ShadowsFlora in the area consists of Pi\u00f1yon Pine and Juniper as well as the red-barked Manzanita bush clinging to tuff ledges high in the canyon.  Wildlife includes Red-tailed Hawks, American Kestrels, Western Scrub-jay, Coyote, Rabbits, Ground Squirrels, and Rattlesnakes.  Be especially watchful during the warmer months of the year for the snakes.\n\nTent Rocks and Tent Rocks Canyon were featured in the 1985 revisionist western Silverado written and directed by Lawrence Kasdan.  Tent Rocks was the hideout for Danny Glover's character.  The cone-shaped formations are obvious in the background of several scenes, and I believe the 'cave' Danny Glover hid out in was filmed in a section of the slot at night.\n\nThe American Canyoneering Academy rating system would consider this canyon very easy at 1A I meaning that it is a non-technical dry canyon that can be accomplished in just a few hours.

Red Rock's entrance is well marked.  After paying the fee, travel about 10 miles to the Pine Creek parking lot.", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\u00a0\r\nRed Rock Canyon has hundreds of ways to play upon the layout of desert and sandstone peaks.  It is deservedly world class and still offers accessibility to isolation for those who extend their path beyond the short BLM trails available.  Although Red Rock's canyons number high, I thought one I would highlight is Terrace Canyon.\r\n\r\nTerrace Canyon is hardly traveled to, but is known by the Las Vegas hiking community.  It is a magical and peaceful place made so by great sights and the sounds of falling water.  And part of the magic is due to the rarity of the moving water, which is found in the Spring with the snow melt.  So there is a window, dependent on rain/snow/temperature, but if you meet it you will experience a stream rolling down the terrace, which is like a series of rock steps.  Think of one of those zen water art plug-in living room pieces; the water in Terrace Canyon has similar motion and noise.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0The payoff for reaching Terrace Canyon may or may not be king, because the obstacle laden canyon scrambling means of reaching it is just as fantastic.  Like many scrambles, you see the puzzle, make a plan of rock jumping, and execute.  However, the rocks you leap to in the canyons here hold onto pinks, purples, and shy blues.  Also, you get to play \"Hot Lava\" with the stream several times.  And actually, on my last visit, the temperature had shifted upward so that we had to take off our shoes, raise our pant legs, and walk some high water.  Take more water along the way though to forecast an even more animated Terrace Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe basic desert hiking rules apply and everyone in your hiking party should be able to handle multiple class 3 moves.  I'd give 6-8 hours, and really the whole of daylight just in case, to attempting Terrace Canyon.\r\n\r\nI hope this guide helps anyone looking for this gem, but I should mention an advisory bit:  Of the 3 times I've attempted this hike, someone has tore open the back of their pants!

The trail is well worn in multiple directions but stay West and aimed at Mescalito.  You want to eventually go in the canyon left (South) of Mescalito.  The way I find best is staying right and when you hit a triangle of rocks marking the divergence of trails, go left.  Then after crossing a wash, there will be lesser trails heading West again.  You cross another wash.  Basically, anything that resembles a trail will work, but you should find a trail between Mescalito and the North bank of the stream flowing from the canyon on the left.  This saves a lot of time that might be spent on rock hopping.  On the way into the canyon you'll see the rocks start to gain color and several colorful Manzanita bushes.  Also, there's what I like to consider a miniature version of the Great Arch (By the Zion tunnel) on the Southern wall.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\nWhen you hit the stream, there isn't any one way but upstream.  It is easy enough to see where some have tread, but there are also secret passages through the bush.  The pools and 2 foot waterfalls along the way can really get you hesitate and gaze before moving on.  There will be another fork in the canyon a bit further, you will go left (South) again.  Try and stay left before getting too close to save yourself from getting lost.  There will be a large pine tree on the left, aim for that.  Some gnarled roots mark the bottom of a stairs climb.  The mouth to the next canyon is a large peppermint striped rock, which I call the Candyland slide.  Climb up.\r\n\r\nFrom here, sift yourself through all kinds of obstacles.  Again, no right way, but the path of least resistance isn't too difficult.  You may think the canyon will dead end early on, but it is only a crook, and will straighten out again.  Also, stay in the center of the canyon, there are cairns for climbing that might throw you off.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, you will find yourself at the third fork and for the third time you will go left.  There will be a large cairn and a bright orange wall to the South.  Immediately, the trail gets less obvious, and this is where we had to remove our boots 2 separate times to get by because the water had risen over.

This is due to its beauty but also because photographers can hike in from the bottom and avoid the technical section. Your adventure will begin by participating in the parks permit system and vying for one of the fifty permits allotted per day. If you are lucky enough to get a permit on the day you want and the weather cooperates then you can get ready for a unique day \"hike\" that is sure to be a real adventure and for some quite a challenge. The hike in and out of the canyon is tough for most day hikers, but add to that cold water swimming and tough obstacles to get over and it will be a day to remember. In Zion, this is often the first technical canyon done by new people to the sport of canyoneering. Some will do it and never want to do another canyon and other become addicted and cannot get enough of canyoneering and they slowly advance to the more technical canyons. For this route you will need some basic canyoneering gear and two vehicles. If you do not have two vehicles then you can always hitch a ride on the Kolob Road at the end of the route to get back to where you parked. Hitchhiking is actually legal inside of the park.\r\n\r\nNon-technical Route - You can choose the easier route that begins at the bottom, starting at the Left Fork Trailhead, and then you would return the same way you entered the canyon. On this 9 mile route you avoid all of the technical obstacles, but there is steep hiking at the entry and exit and slippery moss to contend with along the way.\r\n\r\nTechnical Route - The second option is also about 9 miles long and requires basic canyoneering and swimming skills to navigate the route. These are not leisurely swims, in fact the drop into the first pool is really a shocking experience! The water is not just cold! It's so cold that people tend \"freeze up\" and have to be encouraged to actually get out of the water. This route begins at the Wildcat Canyon Trailhead and ends at the Left Fork Trailhead. \r\n\r\nACA Canyon Rating - 3B III ", "Created/Edited": "Dec21,2007/Feb9,2008", "Gear and Safety": "\u00a0That's me in the CHILLY water of the Subway\r\nBest Time to Go\r\nMid-June to mid-September when the water is warmer. Any other time of the year check to see what the water temperature is. You might need a wet/drysuit.\r\n\r\nGear - Bring a 60 foot rope, a dry bag, wear appropriate water shoes and quick dry clothing - not cotton. Do not hike the Subway during the cool months of the year unless you are experienced in winter canyoneering. Even in the shoulder seasons hikers have gotten into trouble and had to be rescued due to inappropriate clothing and gear. Never jump in these canyons! Use your rope and do not go unless you have some down-climbing skills.\r\n\r\nHi-Tech Clothing - The hi-tech shirts have probably become the most popular form of this type of clothing, often stocked in large department stores amidst regular clothing. The various types of hi-tech clothing are not only comfortable but they are light to wear and to carry so you can dress in layers and then toss into your pack what's not needed. The fabric wicks moisture away from skin and dries quickly which can be essential when hiking in cold weather. You will find the apparels quick dry properties essential in canyons such as the Subway where you are required to swim in shockingly icy cold pools and then when you get out its into the shaded chilly air of the canyon.

Check the weather before going. Never enter a slot canyon when it's raining at the location or upstream from where you will be hiking. Most canyons offer no refuge in the event of a flash flood. Do not think you can out run one or climb to safety. Sticky rubber shoes are essential for canyoneering. Carry enough water for the trip and wear quick dry clothing such as hi-tech shirts and shorts.

{"When To Climb": "You can visit The Wave at any time of day.  In the morning it will be cooler but there will be other people there to possibly ruin your solitude.  In the afternoon it will be hot hot hot if it's summertime but you may get to partake in the beauty all by yourself.  You can also visit The Wave in the winter if you want it to be cool.  Whether or not you get an overcast day is really just a game of chance.  More likely it won't be overcast for you (unless there's a thunderstorm brewing overhead, in which case you've got other problems).  It goes without saying that you should avoid the slot canyons if there is any sign of inclement weather--specifically upstream of the canyons.   Albeit, on a sunny day, the slot canyons will be a cool place to visit (cool as in not hot).  Getting to and from The Wave would not be too particularly dangerous if it were raining.  From the trailhead, you do have to walk in or skirt a wash for about a quarter-mile.  From there, you climb out of the wash by way of an old dirt road.  Once onto the bare rock of Coyote Buttes your bigger worry would be slipping on wet slabs.  There is a small wash to cross just before arriving at The Wave but it probably wouldn't be that inundated.  It could be muddy though.  But there is a bigger problem if it is raining: the access road from US-89 to the trailhead is impassable when wet.  There are a number of signs warning of this.  If it isn't the road surface itself that gets muddy then it is the many washes the road crosses that would make for some interesting if not impossible fords.\n", "Getting There": "To get to the Coyote Buttes/Wire Pass area it is highly recommended that you visit the Paria Contact Station on US-89 first.  This BLM station is located about 40 miles west of Kanab, UT (or about 30 miles west of Page, AZ) on the south side of the road.  The Forest Service Ranger Station in Kanab can give you better directions.  The Kanab ranger station is located east of town on the north side of the road.  The Paria Contact Station has no customer phone number but a ranger at Kanab can make a cell phone call to the Contact Station for you (the cell number is not given out to the public)--especially to inquire as to whether or not any permits are still available for the next day.  Note that permits for the day-of are not given out.  That is, you can only acquire permits for the next day, not the current day even if not all have been utilized.\n", "Camping": "Camping is available at the Paria Contact Station.  I think there is a well here for water.  There is a small fee for use of this campground.  There is a free campground about 2 miles south of the Wire Pass/Wave trailhead along a dirt road.  No water at this campground.  Other full-hook-up privately-owned campgrounds are located in Kanab and Page.  Heck, there's no doubt a KOA in both towns.\n", "Overview": "\n            This page is dedicated mainly to The Wave.  The Wave is not a mountain but it is located in a rugged region known as Coyote Buttes in The Paria Canyon-Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness of Southern Utah/Northern Arizona.  The Wave is a famous hollow (or gully depending on how you look at it) of striated sandstone that visitors typically make reservations to visit seven months or more in advance.  If you are lucky enough to have seen The Wave then you know what I mean.  If you haven't seen The Wave, then you can obtain a permit through the website listed below or show up at the Paria Contact Station out on US-89 the day before (they reserve a certain number of daily permits in this way...for walk ups, as it were; but there is a lottery system in place now, as of at least 2009).  More good info in tarol's post here.  Permits cost $7.\n\nTo be sure, The Wave is not a large area (it could fit within the space of an acre) but it is definitely a sight to behold.  I've heard it is at its best on an overcast day when sun shadows don't create too much contrast between light and dark.  I was there on a sunny day, so I cannot say.  Yet, even on a sunny day it is truly spectacular.  You can visit the The Wave at any time of day.  The position of the sun in the sky changes how The Wave appears to the eye.  I was there in late afternoon/early evening.  Most persons visit The Wave in the morning when it is cool since it is a 5-mile round-trip hike over hot rock and sand to get there.  However, If you can stand the heat, I might suggest going in there in the late afternoon (but not too late else the sun will have dived below the higher mountain to the west thus attenuating your light).  In late afternoon there probably won't be anyone else there to get in the middle of your camera frame.  This was how it was for me.  I was the only one there.  Thus, all my photos presented here with the exception of two timer shots and two silhouette shots will show The Wave in its pristine state.\n\nThere is a set of pillowed buttes next door to The Wave that are also a spectacular sight to behold.  These I have called The Welter for lack of a better word.  One last note, I would recommend wearing sunglasses with an amber tint.  This tint brings out the fantastic colors that much more.To the north of The Wave and the Coyote Buttes is a slot canyon known as Buckskin Gulch/Wire Pass.  This is in Utah. (The Wave is about a 3 tenths of a mile into Arizona.)  The fee for this canyon is a separate $5 ($7 now?) payable at the trailhead.  You can visit the canyon on the way back from or on your way to The Wave.  On the west side of the narrowing northern end of the Coyote Buttes there is a wash that butts up against the bare red rock of the buttes.  Follow this wash north then east then northeast for about seven tenths of a mile as it winds down to the canyon.  The wash meets the canyon (Wire Pass) at a section where it is only 15 feet deep.  You can get into the canyon by walking west slightly.  Go east into the canyon for the best parts.  Wire Pass drains into Buckskin Gulch at a confluence of slot canyons a short distance to the east.  Give yourself 45 minutes to an hour to visit the confluence and hike back out to the car by way of Wire Pass canyon.  Watch out for rattlesnakes and other monsters of the desert.\n\nThere is a Second Wave a few hundred yards south of the Main Wave that is worth a visit too.\n", "Created/Edited": "Aug8,2003/Oct12,2016", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=36.99600&amp;distance_lon_9=-112.00720&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">36.99600\u00b0N/112.0072\u00b0W</a>", "Red Tape": "NOTE (2016):\u00a0 I have heard the rules have changed once again.\u00a0 It is best to contact the authorities or look on official government sites rather than use this information below.\n\nTo get a day-use permit for the next day in the event that you happen to be in the area, visit the Paria Contact Station the day before you intend to go in there and hope they still have permits left for that next day.

If one is approaching from the east that is from the Colorado State Line, travel 45 miles west along I-70 to the town of Thompson Springs. Depart on exit #187 (right hand exit) and turn right at the immediate intersection across from the Shell station. This might be a good time to at least top off the tank. \r\nFollow County Road #159 (Main Street) as it heads north through Thompson Springs passing Seward and Harris Avenues. Once past the triple R.R. crossing, there will be two signs for the Sego Canyon petroglyphs. County Road #159 will head directly up into Thompson Canyon passing by the petroglyphs (on the left) and will eventually morph into a jeep road. \r\n\r\nIf coming from the west or the Moab Valley, merge onto I-70 east at exit #182 at Crescent Junction. Travel an additional five miles east to the Thompson Springs exit and follow the aforementioned directions above. \r\n\r\n* There are no services at Crescent Junction (4,900ft) as many who know who use #191 to get into Moab. There is a remnant shell of a long-ago abandoned diner and a DOE site located out of view to the north. Any hiking or canyoneering done north of Crescent Junction will eventually lead you up into Crescent Canyon or even Floy Wash if one ventures far enough west.  The terrain eventually cliffs out and spills into Renegade Canyon, an offshoot of Thompson Canyon. Past this, Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation land lies.  \r\nThere are Jeep Roads (#223 and #224) and numerous cattle trails that cross the entire area north of I-70 from this junction.

In fact, it\u2019s about the same as what you can expect to pay in Vail. \r\nThere are no other services in Thompson Springs. \r\n\r\n", "The Canyon": "Vehicle friendly:\r\n\r\nThe first part of Thompson Canyon is navigated via CR #159, a short ~5.3 mile dirt road. For the first 3.5 miles, it is indeed, the ONLY road. At roughly mile 3.0, the Sego Canyon petroglyphs are viewable and accessed to the left side (west). There is a small parking area, a couple picnic tables and an outhouse. The petroglyphs are impressive to see especially since they are at least 725 years old. Each of the four panels reflects a different culture except for the forth (located slightly up the road near an old cattle round-up corral). It is damaged fairly extensively from gunshots and graffiti. The following four tables are taken directly from their corresponding plaques:\r\n\r\nGeneral Information:\r\nThe sandstone cliffs that stand above you like a wall become an outdoor art gallery, or a holy place. Native Americans painted and chipped their religious visions, clan symbols, or records and events onto the cliffs. There are three distinct styles or events, which represent three separate cultures and time periods known to have been in the area during the past several thousand years. \r\nThis impressive site, which is on the National register of Historic Places, is undergoing a long-term conservation and preservation treatment. The Antiquities Act of 1906 and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act provides for serious penalties to vandals. To ensure the ancient art\u2019s preservation, please do not touch it, as oils in our skin cause the delicate paint and rock surface to deteriorate. Many recent signatures are present. Why did others sign their names at this valuable site? One can only speculate, please do not add your signature or try to remove any of the signatures.\r\nIndian Rock Art should be left undisturbed for future visitor\u2019s to enjoy and scientists to study. It is best to visit this site as one does in a museum. Look but do not touch. Please remember to take nothing but photographs, leave nothing but footprints.   \r\n\r\n1st Panel: Ute Indians\r\nThe historic Ute rock art is identified and dated by the horse and rider figures. Horses were introduced to North America by the Spanish in the sixteenth century. Other figures, or elements, painted in red and white on the panel include a white bison, a human figure with leggings, several large human figures, and large circles believed to be shields. \u00a0Ute Canyon Panel\r\nThe Ute people practiced a hunting, and gathering lifeway. They used the bow and arrow, made baskets and brownware pottery, and lived in brush wickiups and tipis. The No-tah (Ute people) lived freely throughout Western Colorado and Eastern Utah until about 1880, when they were forced onto reservations. \r\n\r\n2nd panel: Fremont Era\r\nThe Fremont Culture thrived from about A.D. 600 to A.D. 1250, and was contemporary with the Anasazi Culture of the Four Corners area. It is distinguished by its remarkable rock art. Like the Anasazi, the Fremont planted corn and lived in pit houses and surface stone structures. They constructed a distinctive basketry and made pottery. They had a complex social structure, as is illustrated in their rock art and were highly adaptive to the extremes of their environment. At the top of the panel are the oldest figures. These are the [\u2026] of large red painted figures with the rectangular bodies and small heads, which are similar to the Anasazi Basketmaker style. Superimposed on the older, painted figures is a [\u2026] of craved (pecked) human figures. Typically, these have trapezoids for the head and body. The most recent Fremont period is also represented by superimposed carvings. They are the deeply grooved outlines of two life-sized human figures with collars and waistbands, and the associated mountain sheep and abstract elements. This last group is representative of the Classic Fremont Style.\r\n\u00a04th Panel\r\n\r\n3rd  Panel: Barrier Canyon\r\nSome of the most spectacular examples of rock art in the southwest are attributed to Archaic people. Archaic people were nomads, hunting large and small game animals, collecting and processing wild plants. They did not build permanent habituation structures, but lived in caves and small brush shelters built out in the open. They occupied this area from approximately 8,000 years ago until the introduction of corn agriculture about 2,000 years ago. \u00a0Barrier Canyon Panel\r\nThis rock art, the Barrier Canyon style, usually consists of larger than life sized anthropomorphic (manlike) forms. The identifying characteristic of these figures is hollowed eyes or missing eyes, the frequent absence of arms and legs and the presence of vertical body markings. This panel is characterized by at least 19 painted anthropomorphs with bug-eye, antennae, earrings, snakes in hand, and leg-less torsos. The \u201cghost like\u201d images may represent shamanistic art associated with ritual activities of the Archaic people.   \r\n\r\nAt roughly 3.5 miles, there are two side roads that branch off to the right (east). The first of these passes by the old ruin of a house before it cuts directly through a small dirt ridge. The second turn takes a short diagonal drive up to the top of this small dirt ridge, which I believe is nothing more than a heavily eroded section of the huge wall directly north.  Both of these roads will actually meet up on the other side of this low-eroded ridge where they rejoin into County Road #160 before continuing up to the Ghost Town of Sego and disappearing up into the very long valley of Sego Canyon. \r\n\r\nOf particular note, on the top of this small dirt dike, is an old cemetery. This cemetery is not labeled on any current maps. I found it on an USGS Quad map (Sego Canyon) 7.5 minute TOPO. It is not viewable from the main road. There are 18 plots of which only 3 are labeled. The rest are simply mounds with various markings and trappings, those of poor souls who have (probably) passed out of memory. \r\nIt is a rightfully solemn but lonely place. I actually felt moved and sorry for those forgotten.  \r\nIgnoring Sego Canyon for the time being, as this is where Sego Canyon starts, continue to follow the improved dirt road further up into Thompson Canyon. The elevation just past the confluence with Sego is roughly 5,548ft. At mile 4.0, there are three sites of ruins of cabins including what can only be described as an outdoor \u2018Dutch-oven\u2019 or a single coking oven. There is also a large patch of Cottonwoods here, an ideal place for a picnic. At roughly mile 4.9-5.0, the improved dirt road will end. This is also where the right-hand branch of Thompson Canyon is accessed. \r\nPark in the hopscotch clearing on the right and continue down the embankment to the wash and continue on foot. The elevation here is 5,840ft. \r\nThe remaining .3-mile is on rough (but passable for passenger cars) dirt road. It will end abruptly in a small roundabout near a spring (of which after three trips, I still cannot locate). This is the end of the road and the start of your canyoneering trek.", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Entrance to Thompson Cyn.  Make no mistake, of all the canyons that vivisect the Bookcliffs and in general, the Colorado Plateau, most are remote and hard to access; few are technical in nature and fewer still are places where reliable information is available. \r\n\tThompson Canyon is one of the exceptions.  This is a fairly wide canyon where the only necessities one really needs apart from standard desert faire is a sturdy pair of boots and map. Thompson Canyon is a delight. It is easy to access with some interesting features, a few short side canyons and remarkably easy to navigate. \r\nThe Sego Canyon petroglyphs, a bit of a misnomer is located in the early stretches of Thompson Canyon about 3.5 miles north of Thompson Springs. In addition to the petroglyphs, Thompson Canyon also offers some ruins and old homestead sites, a pleasant ~5.3 mile canyon drive to the roads terminus and over nine miles of canyon hiking which doesn\u2019t include the side canyons (Right Hand Branch, Renegade Canyon). \r\nTake the time to explore Thompson Canyon. Chances are you\u2019ll have the whole place to yourself.\r\n\r\nView Larger Map", "Created/Edited": "Feb14,2009/May12,2009", "Time to lace up those boots....": "\u00a0Sego  From on foot, Thompson Canyon is easy to navigate and difficult to actually get lost. The main canyon is open, wide and non-technical. There is abundant scrub and brambles on both sides of the main wash, so follow the streambed when you can to avoid scratches and burrs. From the small roundabout, strike out north on a partially hidden hikers path as it lowers down to the floor. It's a bit narrow at this location and could be soggy. Follow the creek past a huge Oak tree located on the right side. There will be about 20-25m of soggy, packed down brush and plenty of deadfall until the canyon opens up and clears. After 20 minutes of hiking, a barbed wire fence (6,063ft) will be encountered. \r\nPass through this fence (39\u00b003.155N//109\u00b042.983W) and continue on. There is a makeshift barbwire gate located about 30ft to the left but it is difficult to open. Point 6,795 and Point 6,868 will be on your left and right, respectively. \r\nThe main canyon continues to the left, apparent by its size. Go ahead and explore the right side (branch) canyon. This will narrow out to its vertex after 30-45 minutes of walking. The next fork or confluence doesn\u2019t come until 45-75 minutes after this first side branch by way of Renegade Canyon (6,386ft). \r\nThis is an open, shallow and broad area (39\u00b005.120N//109\u00b044.794W). Some maps have this designated as well as the remainder of Thompson Canyon as marsh or wetland. There are a few steep finger canyons along the deeper recesses of Thompson (~6,720ft) but nothing exploreable as they all cliff out and end abruptly. \r\nUpper Thompson Canyon does maintain its breadth. The underbrush to both sides actually thickens and becomes more entangled and dense. There are some steeper side walls along the dying portions and probably worth deemable of some exploration. Just keep in mind scratches and scrapes are inevitable. Follow the canyon for as long as is deemed reasonable. Retrace your steps.\r\n \r\nRenegade Canyon is also worth a side trip if you have the time. The terrain is unremarkably similar to Thompson Canyon but noticeably narrower. Renegade Point is a flattened point on the upper left. This point, if climbed which, would be a feat, provides an entry into Crescent Canyon just one canyon over. \r\n\r\nSego Canyon is hard for me to include here. Reason being it does not offer much in terms of hiking or trekking. There is a main road (in good shape) that winds its way through the whole of the canyon and ends at Hell\u2019s Hole, a gate that marks the boundary of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Past this gate, the road and canyon disappears into the Roan Cliffs and the West Tavaputs Plateau. There is a massive parking area located here for hunters during season. The trees and terrain are very different at the top of Sego Canyon as compared to what is initially encountered at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPast the old town site of Sego (about 1.2 miles), the road will drop down into Sego Canyon proper and course its way for about 2.2 miles before it starts to rise in elevation. There is very little opportunity to explore side canyons. But, Sego Canyon is deeper cut then Thompson and does offer some very good scenery.   \r\nAt the top of Sego Canyon at Hell\u2019s Hole gate, the reservation does allow hunters to travel across their property during hunting season to access the roadless areas that lie outside of their boundary. The elevation at this point approaches 8,400ft and is very noticeable.      \r\nLegends of America: Sego Canyon\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=39.05222&amp;distance_lon_9=-109.72139&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">39.05222\u00b0N/109.72139\u00b0W</a>", "Season": "Spring,Summer,Fall,Winter", "Location": "Utah,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"},

Spanning over 13 miles, this canyon is home to several large peaks, an extensive trail network, a couple of lakes, beautiful scenery and lots of wildlife. It is because of this is why Millcreek Canyon is popular with mountain bikers, trail runners, peak baggers, dog walkers, backcountry skiers, rock climbers, hikers, campers, and wildlife observers. In the summer and fall months you are allowed to drive your car up to the base of Big Water Gulch (Approximately 10 miles). In late fall, winter and spring the main road is closed to vehicular traffic about 5 miles up from the base of the canyon. Some peaks in this canyon that are worth climbing to are Mount Aire, Grandeur Peak, Little Water Peak, and Gobblers Knob. Each one of these peaks offers a unique and impressive view of the surrounding Wasatch Range. Some trails worthy of checking out are the Pipline Trail, Big Water Gulch Trail (aka The Dog Lake Trail) and the Desolation Trail. Wildlife such as Black Bears, Cougars, Moose, large Deer herds, and Rattle Snakes frequently rome this canyon so keep as close eye out there....because there might just be one on you. Be sure to not travel alone at night, keep pets close to you and carry bear spray. \u00a0\nTroy standing on the summit of Little Water Peak\u00a0\nBrad hiking in some fall colors\u00a0\nMount Aire from the North East.

Each peak offers its own unique views of the Salt Lake City valley and of the surrounding peaks in the Central Wasatch Range. Most of the trails to these peaks are inbetween 1,500 to 4,000 vertical feet one way. This section will have a short description of the peaks in Millcreek Canyon in order of the ones I liked the best. \n\nGobblers Knob- Standing tall at 10,246 feet, this is one of the better peaks of Millcreek Canyon if not the Central Wasatch Range. The Porter Fork trailhead is the most popular starting point for summiting this mountain. From Porter Fork there are 3 seperate trails to the summit. Starting from the base up they are Bowman Fork, Yellow Jacket Gulch and Pole Canyon. Another less popular and more extream route is Alexander Basin. Caution should be used here in the winter months. This Basin has been the site of several brutal avalanche accidents in years past and even this year (Feb. 7th 2010).

With Dog Lake along the trail to the summit, one can expect to encounter large crowds on the weekends (especially in summer). Once you get past the lake the remaining mile is quite lonely.

In the winter months the road is closed so you will have to start 1.5 miles down canyon from here.

{"Activities": "Hiking,Canyoneering", "Getting There": "The canyon starts near the historic Hidden Splendor Mine at the southern end of the San Rafael Swell.

Turn left off the offramp (or right if coming from the west), and continue on the very high quality frontage road that parallels the freeway for a short distance then turns south.

To get to the Old Ford, turn left onto a side road 3 miles before reaching Hidden Splendor and drive this narrow track about a half mile to the old blue 1950's Ford car where there is room for a handful of cars. A high clearance vehicle is likely required to drive this final half mile otherwise you'll have to park along the Hidden Splendor road at the junction with this short road.\u00a0Where the old car sits is where the hike officially starts. There is also a sign posted that says \"Quandary Canyon foot trail\"\nView of the Henry Mountains from the road to Hidden Splendor", "Maps": "\nThis large map shows the different slot canyons in the southern portion of the San Rafael Swell including Miners Hollow (Knotted Rope Canyon)\n\nMap showing Miners Hollow (Knotted Rope Canyon) by Tom Jones\n", "Overview": "\n            Miners Hollow is a fun canyon between Quandary Canyon and the Muddy River Gorge in the southern part of the San Rafael Swell. Although not as difficult or as long as Quandary Canyon which lies just to the east, it is still an awesome outing offering history, potholes and stunning scenery. This canyon is one where you want to make sure you know whether or not all the potholes are filled with water or not. Miners Hollow is a completely different canyon when filled with water.This area was one of the richest Uranium mines back in the days of the Utah Mining boom in the 1950's. This was a time when Uranium was in high demand due to World War II and Miners did some pretty incredible things at Hidden Splendor to try to get it. One on the most notable was the road they constructed and blasted out of the reef that started where the old Ford sits and went up and over the reef into upper Quandary Canyon. Many other roads were plowed out of the steep talus all around the backside of the reef. Miners also had drilling equipment helicoptered up to the to of the reef which included thousands of feet of metal pipe to pump water up from Muddy River. A small mining shed with a large wood stove is along with drill hole remains are found at the upper end of both Quandary Canyon and Miners Hollow. As you work your way through Quandary Canyon, you will hike on this old road, see remnants of blasting and pass a drill hole with old mining equipment. If you continue west towards Miners Hollow, you will come across a long pipeline that at one point pumped water 1,400 feet up from the river below.\nSome people get very angry when they see mining remnants in a beautiful place like this however I see it as an interesting side trip where I take myself back in time and wonder what it was like during those days. Being a geologist myself I kind of enjoy seeing these things in such remote places. It puts things into perspective to realize that these areas are only very recently used for recreation. Not too long ago no one ever came to these parts and the ones who did were there for long periods of time living in hardship in the mines or as outlaws. Now we go to these areas only a few days at a time for fun. A lot has changed in a very short period of time.The Hidden Splendor closed in the late 50's when the US government quit subsidizing the Uranium boom and most of the mines in the area closed with most of the equipment deserted. Another big mine in the San Rafael Swell was the Temple Mountain mine at at Temple Junction there was once a small town with a saloon and a post office. Today, only the foundations remain of this place. Turning off Highway 24 onto the Temple Mountain Road towards Goblin Valley, take a few minutes to roam around the foundations located on the southwest side of the intersection.More recently, the San Rafael Swell may be the home of more activity as the BLM just leased section of the Swell near the Head of Sinbad and Eagle Canyon where I-70 cuts through. Within the next few years, natural gas wells will likely be found in the center of the Swell and the area will once again be active. Since the swell is basically a huge anticline, the apex of the fold makes an excellent natural gas trap and there is potentially a very large reserve of methane under the center of the swell. Climbers and canyoneers with a keen eye will notice the Wingate sandstone which makes the steep cliffs along the back side of the reef aren't as red colored as the Wingate around Moab and Canyonlands National Park. Actually, the Navajo (which is typically white) and the Wingate are hard to differentiate in the San Rafael Swell which is a result of natural gas leeching much of the iron oxide that is usually found in the Wingate Sandstone.\u00a0\nSunset seen from the Hidden Splendor Mine - Notice the white colored Wingate cliffs", "Red Tape/Camping": "This entire area lies on BLM lands...practice \"Leave No Trace\" practices.

This first pothole can be traversed around on the right side. Beyond this, climb up on the left side of the canyon bottom to bypass a few more small potholes and descend slabs back to the bottom and make an 8 foot slide down. After this slide, you will be unable to bypass the next 5-10 potholes. If they are all full of water, they are all easy wades with a couple being full swimmers. A wetsuit is mandatory unless it's mid-summer. If the potholes are dry, there are 2 keeper type potholes where pothole escape techniques are required to escape. The first of these keeper potholes is a 10 foot deep pothole which has claimed the life of a woman who fell inside trying to traverse around it and broke her arm.

Here the canyon taken a sharp right turn and soon drops into the Muddy River Gorge via a 280 foot rappel with a poor anchor. It's best to avoid making this long free hanging rappel due to the poor anchor situation and the fact you would need to carry 100 pounds of rope through the canyon!

There are some shallow narrows before reaching a 100 foot rappel, the only technical obstacle in the canyon.   Below that, there are only minor obstacles including one short and non-exposed class 3 ten foot drop and a short section very minor bushwhacking.\r\n\r\nLooking down the 100' foot rappel in Three Canyon.\r\n\r\nSneak Route\r\n\r\nThe Sneak Route is my favorite entrance and exit to Lower Three Canyon.  The route is rated 5.6 and has a few antique bolts along it.  If you are using this as an exit route and you don't want to free solo the 5.6 climb, you can fix a rope, handline, or aider at the crux of the route before you climb up it.  This is a very fun route, but has some exposure.\r\n\r\nPart of the 5.6 section of the Sneak Route. I left the aider because I didn't want to freesolo it alone. Notice the chipped Moki step.\r\n\r\nMap showing the Upper Three Canyon Route and Sneak Route. Click for full size.\r\n\r\nJunes Bottom\r\n\r\nThis route won't be discussed in detail here, but you can access Junes Bottom via a very old and washed out road off the canyon rim.  An old, faded, and very rugged cattle trail accesses the mouth of Three Canyon by traversing the talus above the Green River.   This is the route I used to use to access Three Canyon, but it isn't as fun as the other routes.\r\n\r\nTrin Alcove Horse Trail\r\n\r\nThis route also won't be described in much detail here, but from the end of the \"Designated Off-Road Route\" beyond the Sneak Route Trailhead, an old horse trail drops off a shallow rim.  It has access to the Green River.   You can access the mouth of Three Canyon by traversing a small ledge above the river and to the mouth of Three Canyon.  This is a good route, but if the route is wet or icy, beware of slipping and falling into the river!\r\n\r\nLabyrinth Canyon/Green River \r\n\r\nThree Canyon can be and often is accessed from the Green River through Labyrinth Canyon, which makes and excellent multi-day rafting or canoeing (better) trip. \r\n\r\nSneak Canyon \r\n\r\nSneak Canyon itself can be descended and is a nice slot canyon.  The biggest rappel is just over 90 feet.\r\n\r\nBaby Slot\r\n\r\nThe Baby Slot is the canyon that drains into Three Canyon east of Sneak Canyon. It can also be descended and is a good, but short slot canyon followed by an 154 foot rappel. \r\n\r\nRoute Page \r\n\r\nHere is a route page describing the descent of Upper Three Canyon and exiting out the Sneak Route and Lower Three Canyon.

There is only minor flash flood potential in this canyon.\r\n\r\nThis is a land of weather extremes. Temperatures in the nearest town have ranged from -42F (-41C) to 113F (45C) at Green River.

It is in the greater Robbers Roost area as well, but quite a bit north of the main part of the Roost.\r\n\r\nThree Canyon is usually ignored by hikers and canyoneers. The entry and exit routes are hard enough to keep out hikers, and since the canyon has few technical obstacles and is mostly a hike, and since there isn\u2019t a real slot, not many technical canyoneers do the canyon either. What the canyon is however, is probably the most beautiful of all the side canyons draining into Labyrinth Canyon of the Green River. The high walls streaked with desert varnish, the oasis in the desert, the small cascades, deep narrows, and crystal clear running water make the trip very pretty. \r\n\r\nThree Canyon did get some attention in the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s when some of our friends put the canyon in a guidebook and on a website, but as more canyons became known, Three Canyon more or less has dropped off the radar again.

You are aiming for the first main drainage you see just to the east. It's a gentle slightly downhill walk over sand and through sagebrush to the drainage above the start of the slot canyon. Once you enter the drainage turn right and head southward down the canyon. It will quickly start to narrow and you will arrive at the first drop that you can walk around and down to the left side. This drop gets you down through the Page Sandstone to the contact with the Navajo. From here you will start working your way through a shallow slot with a couple easy drops. If it's sunny and hot you will be exposed to the sun for the first third of the canyon so be prepared to stay hot.\nLooking down from the start of Monkey Business Slot\n\nStemming in the upper open section\n\nDropping into the canyon near the top\nEventually you will get deeper into the slot where you will have a few drops that must be down climbed which can be intimidating for beginners. One of these is a long friction slide of about 30 feet. Help others down/spot if needed. You will then come to a difficult 15 foot descent at in-cut\u00a0section on the left wall of the canyon. There are a few chalkstones wedged into this in-cut section which you can lay on your belly and tie a piece of webbing around (which I did) to set up a very short rappel. Once down that continue down canyon past some narrow sections to an open area where you can scramble out of the canyon on the right side. If you are not equipped to rappel, you must exit the canyon here as it gets technical below. Just past this open area with the exit, the canyon slots up quickly and you come to the first of three rappels in the canyon. This first rappel is anchored by a large set of rocks buried under lots of sand with a long piece of webbing. Be sure to check it before weighting it. Start down a vertical chute which allows for easy rappelling, into a small pothole. Easily exit the pothole to the right (looking down canyon)\u00a0while staying on rappel and head down a dark section to another pothole where you then drop over and down to the canyon floor below. You'll need a 60 meter rope to make this corkscrew rappel. We found another anchor in the lower pothole consisting of a rock buried in some sand that we had to re-make because we were dumb and pulled our rope in the first pothole.

This 12 meter drop leads right into a moderate sized (usually dry) pothole where most people can climb out or be helped out from a second person. Just past this you can climb out to the left side of the canyon and bypass a series of small potholes and shallow narrows. You will get to the last big drop which takes you down to the wide open gorge below. This 20 meter drop is anchored from a couple pieces of webbing wrapped around a nice horn. Rappel down the slab to the lip of the drop and finish down the vertical drop. The last bit of the rappel is free where the wall gets undercut at the Navajo/Kayenta contact.

This is your exit route and you simply hike up this side canyon and scramble up. The hardest part of the climb is the first move where you climb up a loose third class section. Continue steeply on semi-loose rock until you get about 2/3 the way up and you'll see a cairn that directs you to the right. Head around to the right on Navajo Sandstone following cairns until you get to the rim. Once at the rim you will have to walk across open desert to where ever your car is parked.

As you enter the canyon you are greeted with towering reddish cliffs formed from ancient alluvial materials. The 60- to 80-feet high wall on the north (left) side of the canyon is a hard conglomerate rock that shows bands of different-sized alluvial materials. If you trace the bands along the wall, you can see little faults and offsets where the rock fractured, slipped, and the bands no longer line up properly.

The top of the arch is even with top of the cliffs on the south side, but not as high as the wall on the north side. \r\n\r\n\r\nContinuing up the canyon beyond Natural Bridge, you quickly come to a fairly thin, rocky fin that sticks out into canyon from the south wall.

Here, the rock has fractured and one side of the fault has eroded to form a cave. \r\n\r\nA few minutes above Cave Fault, you get to a point where the canyon walls change from alluvial deposits to the metamorphic rocks that form the mountains that tower above Death Valley. Here, you can see that the alluvial deposits were laid down on top of the metamorphic \"parent material\" and that the forces of erosion have cut down through both of them. In places, you can see where alluvial deposits are stuck to the sides of the metamorphic canyon walls and haven't yet completely eroded away. In the metamorphic rock, which originally was sedimentary rock, you can see pretty swirls of blue, red, gray, and white, especially where the water has polished the rock.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphic rocks are harder than the alluvial materials, so they erode more slowly along the bottom of the wash, and shortly after getting into the metamorphic rocks, you arrive at two water-polished pour-overs. The two pour-overs involve a bit of scrambling, maybe climbing, and are fairly easy to get over, but the slick, water-polished rock is covered with dust and gravel, so watch your step.

Many people who visited amazing beauty of Mrtvica Canyon told that Mrtvica canyon was made very deep and great impression on them. Maybe the best prove of that is THIS amazing postcard of Mrtvica Canyon, made from helicopter by famous Serbian photographer Branislav Strugar.\r\n\r\nThe Mrtvica River runs at the foot of the northern side of Mt Maganik 2139 m) and empties into the Moraca River. Mrtvica is placed in SE part of beautifully Moracke Planine. \r\n\r\nThe whole Mrtvica Canyon is 8 km long, 35km far from Kolasin, in the direction of Podgorica. The banks of the river Mrtvica, the right tributary of the Moraca river, are steep, high and abundant with vegetation. At certain places, they are more then 1100 m high. \r\n\r\nThe narrow sandy path has carved its way through the canyon. Specially attractive are springs called \"Bijeli nerini\" \u2013 White \"nerins\". On the Mrtvica river near Zeleni Vir (Green Wortex), there is an old stone bridge built by prince Knjaz Danilo II Petrovic as a memorial to his mother. The river\u2019s cleanse waters abound with trout, huchen and other rare species. \r\n\r\n\u00a0The Gate of Wishes \"Treasury of Nature\" title is without doubt the right tributary of the Mrtvica Canyon. The canyon of the river Mrtvica seems astonishing, almost terrifying in its wild beauty. It is unexplored and unknown partly (for those who enjoy in nature there is marked way). It abounds in vegetation, typical for deep canyon there are remains of ecosystems of the rainforest. It is perplexed with whirlpools (Zvona, Rikavica, famous Bijeli Nerimi, Jame...). Along the river bottom, enormous store blocks with \"gigantic cylinders\" and \"pockets\" are scattered, which the river has shaped for millions of years. Green, clear whirlpools, stream falls and play of darkness in the rainforests and luxurious sunlight on the vertical cliffs give unforgettable impressions and feeling of lasting restless eternity. Conjunction of Maganik (2139 m) mountain and magnificent canyon excludes national proportions and belongs to world treasury of nature qualities and values. Writers, explorers and those fond of unspoiled nature. \r\n\r\nImpressive beauty of Mrtvica Canyon offer amazing adventure par excellance and for sure unforgetable deep impressions to anyone who visit it.

Bus usually stops in front of Bjelasica Hotel. From that point, you walk about 300 m back on the road, to an overpass, with few houses around it, then turn right on an asphalt road (this road is on the left, when coming from Podgorica, just so that there is no confusion). Soon after that you cross the steel bridge over Moraca. 50 m further from the bridge is a little path going left. It is very important that you don't miss this path. Left of the path Mrtvica river joins Moraca river. Across Mrtvica there iz a village Stanci. 500 m further is a beautiful Danilov Most bridge (legacy of Knjaz Danilo II Petrovic), next to it is a stone plate with an inscription. On that small crossroads, you shouldn't go straight and reach a small water mill, but, without crossing the bridge, go on a narrow path that goes upward and to the right. The first 150 m you go through the bushes, and after crossing a stream, turn right. After another 500 m you'll find a stone-paved road that goes on for about 3 km. It ends in the proximity of few houses, and from there on it's a path again. From that point on your left you can see the wooden bridge over Mrtvica, across which is a way to Mrtvo Duboko village. From there on the canyon narrows, and you can't miss the way to Velje Duboko: mostly on the right (looking up the river). In that part of the way leads you under the mountain peaks: Razbijena Jela (1687 m) on the left side, across Mrtvica; Venac (1345 m) and Lijesnje (1187 m) on the right. On that vary part, between Venac and Lijesnja, there is an impressive track, cut into the cliffs (made by former Yugoslav army) that goes 50 m above Mrtvica River. The part of it, of course, was man-made (no use explaining it, though, you should see it for yourselves). In the final part, the canyon widens again, there is much more vegetation. Then trail crosses over to the right bank (on the Mt Maganik side). At the high water of Mrtvica river at this point the crosspassing of the river may be dangerous. By the end of May the riverbad is mostly dry. The greatest height of the canyon is 1100 m in the area of the Razbijena Glava katun (lodge).

{"Routes Overview": "\u00a0\r\nrapping into Mystery Springs2\r\nApproach to the head of the canyon\r\n\r\nThere are at least two approaches to the head of the canyon.  \r\n    \r\nThe recommended route is the trail from Weeping Rock, past Observation Point, and along the East Mesa Trail to the head of the canyon.      This is the only practical route, requires no car shuttle, and is the most scenic option.\r\n\r\nAn alternate route is from the East Mesa Trailhead.    This route requires much less elevation gain, but requires a long car shuttle (the shuttle bus does not go to the East Mesa Trailhead), and is less scenic.     This route is not recommended.      Only the laziest of all canyoneers will consider doing this route to save a few thousand feet elevation gain.      If you try this route, shame on you!\r\n\r\nWhichever route is chosen, make sure you are at the head of the right canyon before descending.   Although I don\u2019t understand why, several parties have gotten lost and ended up in the wrong canyon needing rescue.     With a map in hand, the canyon is easy to find.\r\n\r\nDescent Route\r\n\r\nThere is only one descent route.   Follow the canyon to the North Fork Virgin River.   Once in the canyon there are no navigational difficulties.    After a long start through the \u201cDeath Gully\u201d, there are several downclimbs and rappels before reaching the river.     Most sources give the number of rappels at between 11-13, but many drops are downclimbable.     We did the route in five raps, but a belay is in order for several of the downclimbs.    Do whatever is safe for your own party and make sure to check all anchors.\r\n\r\nSee the ROUTE PAGE for details on the route.\r\n\r\nEcho Canyon and Mystery Canyon combo        \r\n\r\nSince both canyons share the same trailheads and part of the access route, you can do both Echo and Mystery Canyons together in one day.    If you are feeling stong and have a full day, this is the recommended option to take.

This is a beautiful canyon, but in my opinion has been over developed with climbing anchors, many of them fairly new. \r\n\r\nEven though many of the technical challenges have been tamed down, don\u2019t get the wrong idea that this canyon is for the inexperienced. It would be foolhardy for anyone to try and descend Mystery Canyon without the proper skills. There have already been several parties rescued from the canyon-don\u2019t be another one.\r\n\r\nThis canyon is highly recommended for those that have the proper skills needed, but whom are not ready for some of the more challenging canyons elsewhere in Zion or on the Colorado Plateau. At a minimum every member of the group should be well versed in rope skills used by rock climbers and especially in rappelling. \r\n\r\nMystery canyon had its first descent several decades ago. At least one place, rebar is pounded into a hole for an anchor attesting to the creativity or frugality of early canyoneers. The canyon now sees many parties in the May through October season.\r\n\r\nEven with all the permanent anchors and development in the canyon, it is still a beautiful route.

The three main bridges are Sipapu, Kachina, and Owachomo and they span White Canyon and a tributary of Armstrong Canyon.  All of the bridges can be seen from viewpoints along the 9-mile scenic one-way paved loop road... but you can't beat the hike to see them up close and personal and stand beneath them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can hike to all three bridges on a 8.7-mile loop trail.  I recommend starting this trail at the Owachomo Bridge parking area, hiking across the pinyon pine and juniper covered mesa first, then descending into White Canyon to Sipapu Bridge.  There are steep staircases and ladders that you must descend to get down into the canyon.  Once in the canyon the hiking is easy but the trail can be a little difficult to find in spots.  Many hikers make a wrong turn near Kachina Bridge and hike down White Canyon and out of the Monument.  Watch carefully for trail markers in this area and head up Armstrong Canyon instead.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0Horsecollar Ruin\r\nIf you look carefully while hiking in the canyon you can spot many sites where there are Ancestral Puebloan ruins and rock art.  Defacing or removing any of these artifacts is illegal.  Some ruin sites have a register that you can sign.  \r\n\r\nA short 1-mile mostly level trail from the road leads to an overlook of Horsecollar Ruin.  This is the most famous ruin in the canyon but there are many more!  The challenge is to find them...  And again, the overlook is okay, but it's more fun to get down in the canyon and see the ruins up close.  But please don't touch them and definitely don't climb on them.  \r\n\r\n\u00a0Sipapu Bridge\u00a0Kachina Bridge\u00a0Owachomo Bridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSipapu Bridge is the largest of the three bridges at about 270 feet long and the 2nd largest natural bridge in the world (the first is Rainbow Bridge near Lake Powell).  In Hopi \"Sipapu\" is an opening to the spirit world.  \r\n\r\nKachina Bridge is the 2nd largest at about 205 feet long and the youngest.  It is still being carved out by water thus the hole is relatively small and the bridge is massive.  In Hopi \"Kachina\" is a dancer that is an integral part of their religion.  \r\n\r\nOwachomo Bridge is the 3rd largest at about 108 feet long and it's the oldest.  Its thin delicate span is symmetrical and beautiful.  In Hopi \"Owachomo\" means rock mound and indeed there is a prominent rock mound on the southeast end of the bridge.  The hike out of the canyon is shortest and easiest at Owachomo Bridge.\r\n\r\nProspector Cass Hite discovered the bridges in 1883 while he was exploring up White Canyon from the Colorado River.

Running water has worked its way into the fault, widening it and exposing marble and breccia walls.   The marble walls are Noonday Dolomite, created when the limestone deposited on the ocean floor 900 million years ago was subjected to intense heat and pressure.

Stem down a little bit and walk on a nice ledge on the right side of the canyon and avoid the pothole. Just as you round the corner to the right you will notice a very nice arch. When you can see the arch it is a short jump to the sand below. Just past this is rappel 2. The anchor for rappel 2 is a large chalkstone and the rappel starts down a tight slot then becomes overhanging halfway down. Once you touch the ledge below the overhanging spot you can walk to either side and reach the canyon bottom once again. This drop is about 35 feet.\u00a0\nScott descending on the ledge to avoid the pothole.\n\nLooking down the pothole drop. The ledge to use is on the right.\n\nUnder the arch\n\nLooking back at rappel 2. The overhanging section seen right in the middle\nBeyond rappel 2 the canyon opens up a bit and you pass bu some nice cottonwood trees. Walk down canyon and you will quickly come to rappel 3 which is done off a chalkstone. On this 25 foot drop it is angled so use caution when rappelling to avoid bashing your hands on something. Continue down and pass by a spot where you may find some water but it's pretty easy to stem over or bypass by climbing up the right side on a large ledge and descending back down slickrock right before the anchor for rappel 4. This is another deadman anchor that we added some rocks to and you rappel down a 45 foot drop with somewhat of an awkward start since you don't want to pull up on the anchor at all.\u00a0\nWalking through the open section after Rappel 2\n\nLooking at Rappel 3\n\nWalking around some water. Rappel 4 is below\nAfter rappel 4 the canyon slots up and you will come across another chalkstone with an anchor for a short 12 foot drop that can be down-climbed if you are fairly tall by stemming on both sides and working your way down. You could also handline or rappel this short drop. Just past this is another short drop under a chalkstone and down a 6 foot dryfall that you can simply slide down. I actually went over the chalkstone and basically jumped down but there was less sand here so it would be best to have someone spot your landing. After a few more minutes down canyon you will come to the final rappel (Rappel 5) off on a deadman anchor. This 30 foot drop was pretty simple however you really don't want to pull up on this anchor so you will have to start the rappel by down climbing a bit. After everyone makes this drop it is a short hike back to the highway. Turn right and hike north along the road for 0.2 miles back to your car.\u00a0\nLooking down the short drop that can be DC'ed\n\nLooking down the short slide down\n\nScott on the final rappel (Rappel 5)\n\n"},
{"When To Climb": "The New River Gorge has a vast number of climbing routes, from novice to high expert. I am aware of climbing in all months, but I would assume Spring and Fall are best, with Summer likely being quite hot in the gorge. I have seen photos of ice climbing in the gorge in Winter.\r\n\r\n", "Mountain Conditions": "One can generally get a good idea of the weather by checking Beckley, Summersville, or points north or south depending on what part of the gorge one wants to enter.\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "To get to the National Park Service Canyon Rim Visitors Center, take Highway 19. The center is just north of the New River Gorge Bridge. 30 minutes north of Beckley, 30 minutes south of Summersville, 70 minutes southeast of Charelston.\r\n\r\nThere are literally hundreds of routes into the gorge along its length.\r\n\r\nFor information on Hawks Nest State Park, a good location to enter the gorge, go here.\r\n\r\nAnd for information on Babcock State Park, which offers trails into prongs of the gorge, go here.\r\n\r\n", "Camping": "Various camping areas in the gorge, some administered by the NPS, some by the state of WV, some private.\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            The New River Gorge varies in depth all along its several hundred mile journey through WV, VA, and NC. In places it is over 1,000 feet deep, and in others its banks are merely a few inches above the level of the river. The river itself varies from Class IV whitewater to a meandering stream that seems to barely creep. The most spectacular portions of the Gorge are, of course, in West Virginia. Some of the best climbing, hiking, and rafting on the east coast can be found in and around the New River Gorge in that state. And, as most people know, despite its name, the New River is probably the oldest river in North America, and one of the oldest on Earth.\r\n\r\nI posted the location for the Gorge at the New River Gorge Bridge and NPS Canyon Rim Visitors Center.\r\n\r\nFor a nice animated panorama of the Gorge from the Canyon Rim, go here.\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<arel=\"noindex\"style=\"color#249;\"href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=9&amp;distance_9=100&amp;distance_lat_9=38.04210&amp;distance_lon_9=-81.04700&amp;map_9=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.04210\u00b0N/81.047\u00b0W</a>", "Created/Edited": "Aug18,2004/Mar12,2006", "Red Tape": "None of which I am aware.\r\n\r\n", "Location": "WestVirginia,UnitedStates,NorthAmerica"}
