So reservation is obligatory.\r\nIn 1878 about 100 mountain-addicted Austrian people grounded the \u201eAlpenklub \u00d6sterreich\u201c (Alpine Club Austria). In the same year they decided to built a hut at the Adlersruhe.

From Calgary take the Trans Canada (1) west through Canmore, Banff to Lake Louise. For Lake O'Hara you must continue for another 20 minutes on the TransCanada.\r\n\r\nVia Lake Louise If your daring and willing to risk fate then go via the \"The Death Trap\".

This is were all the big avalanches run, so be careful!\r\n\r\nThe alternative to the \"Death Trap\" is the asending the \"Fuhrmann Ledges, a lower shoulder of Mount Lefroy and following the upper portion to Abbot's pass. This is briefly described in Bill Corbett's \"the 11,000ers of the Canadian Rockies\". Which is a worthwhile addition to anyones climbing guide's library.\r\n\r\nIf your looking for the safe approach, then go via Lake O'Hara. The approach takes half a day, but except for the last 500 feet of scree up to Abbots pass it is an easy effort. \r\n\r\nFirst catch the shuttle bus which is the only vehicle allowed on the road pas the parking lot (contact the Alpine Club of Canada for hut & bus reservations) or hike the 13km up the dirt road. It is closed to private vehicles. Follow the trail left around the edge of Lake O'Hara up to Lake Oesa and then continue up the steep slopes, north to Abbot Pass.

During high-summer, it is a shade-less hell with a billion blood-sucking biting bugs.  Having a pleasant camping trip is more about timing\u2014if you avoid coming in the summer, you should be fine. \r\n\r\nWith all of that, there two highly compelling reasons you would want to camp Antelope Island. \r\n\r\n\r\nA: Cost for a day trip $10. Cost to Camp is only $5 bucks more ($15 total)\r\n\r\nB: It puts you into what\u2019s essentially a game preserve. At night. Unsupervised. What can possibly happen?\r\n\r\nThere are 3 camping areas on Antelope Island with a total of 52 sites; White Rock, Bridger Bay and Ladyfinger.  All of the sites are on the north side of the island within a couple of miles of each other; there isn\u2019t any camping on the island\u2019s south side.  White Rock and Bridger Bay are good for RVs/Campers while Ladyfinger (with 8 sites) is tent only and no campfires. \r\n\r\nWhite Rock, located just south of Buffalo Point is a treeless series of sites situated along the dirt road.  This is the campground for if you have horses. Sites have a barbeque grill and a picnic table. \r\n\r\nBridger Bay is on the north-east side of Buffalo Point.  It is also treeless, but is more of a conventional campground. The sites accommodate either tents or RVs.  Sites have a covered picnic table, fire pit and barbeque grill. \r\n\r\nLady Finger, located near the Egg-Island trailhead (NE side of the Island, kind of near the Visitor Center) is straight-up tent only in isolated areas of cleared sage brush. No fires allowed! Sites have a picnic table. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Winter on Antelope\r\n\r\nSecuring a campsite on Antelope Island follows one of two critical paths. The first option is to load up your vehicle, drive out to the island and consign yourself to benevolent Providence there are available sites. Most of the time (especially during the week), you\u2019ll be in luck and there will be sites available. The campsites do have a tendency to fill up quickly during holiday weekends, pretty weather, and/or buffalo round-up times. In those cases, your better option is to go to ReserveAmerica.com website and reserve a spot. \r\n\r\nPerversely, going to the website is more expensive than simply showing up as they charge an $8.00 reservation fee (your $15 campsite is now $23)     \r\n\r\nBridger Bay is open and reserveable Year-Round while White Rock is closed December-March. Camping in a campground is your only on-island option; no dispersed or backcountry camping allowed. \r\n", "Hassles and Limiting Factors": "\u00a0Sentry in Winter\r\n\r\nLIMITING FACTORS\r\n\r\nNo Water in Campgrounds-- Available at Bridger Bay (BB) Beach, Dump Station, and Visitor Center.\r\n\r\nNo Flush Toilets in Campgrounds \u2013 Pit toilets available.  Flush toilets located at the BB Beach and Visitor Center\r\n\r\nNo Firewood \u2013 none for sale on island, no gathering allowed.  Bring your own\r\n\r\nNo Grocery Stores on island\r\n\r\nNo Gas for sale on island\u2014come with a full tank!\r\n\r\nHASSLES\r\n\r\nThe weather on Antelope Island is strange and can fool you. For instance, the weather can be calm in-land yet screaming along at 50 mph out on the island.  It\u2019s an odd phenomenon made odder by the fact you can literally see the island from your house and still get surprised with a difference in conditions. That being said, you can reasonably plan for it to be hot in summer, cold in the winter, and both in spring/fall. Read the weather report carefully before taking off for your camping trip. \r\n\r\nThe bugs on Antelope are phenomenal, a biblical plague. They are usually swarming in late spring, summer and early fall. The worst are biting gnats and they are voracious, blood sucking creatures who spare neither man nor beast in their drive to slake their soulless hungers. Plan your camping trip with this in mind. If you are planning a trip, windy conditions normally disrupts them and makes them less of a problem.  Cold weather also limits their swarms. There is a sign at the causeway gate informing visitors that you won\u2019t get your money back just because bugs make you miserable. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Head up Frary\r\n\r\nAntelope Island gets a lot of visitors\u2026300,000 a year.  Spring and Fall seem to be the high times, Summer somewhat less and Winter almost nobody. During peak times the island gets tour buses and/or waves of visitors hitting the most popular sites (Buffalo Point, Frary Peak, Fielding Garr). Even with these high volumes, with a little advance planning there is a good chance you\u2019ll have the trails to yourself.  Misanthropes, recluses and sociopaths still find their happy spot by visiting mid-week, off-season. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Bridger Bay Campground\r\n\r\nOFF LIMITS AREAS\r\n\r\nThere are a number of places on Antelope you are not supposed to be. Yes, there are rangers and \u201cyes\u201d they will ticket you.  The island is also patrolled by volunteers who can also ticket you.  Both Egg Island and White Rock are closed to access year-round to protect nesting birds.  The Mountain area south of Sentry Trail (to include Molly\u2019s Nipple) is off-limits.  In fact, going off trail anywhere on the island is an invitation to get a ticket. Stay on the trail and read the map. \r\n\r\nCELL PHONES:\r\n\r\nCell phone service is spotty everywhere on island, finding a sweet spot with actual coverage is sometimes a matter of moving 10 feet.  You should be able to get some service on the East side of the island but pretty much everything (including phone service) shuts down once you are on the west side of the island. Don\u2019t count on your cell phone working! \r\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Resupply ": "\u00a0The Island \r\n\r\nThere are no grocery stores, gas stations, or other commercial facilities on Antelope Island.

Antelope Island closes to the public once a year for an annual hunt, usually in early December.  While some might object to shooting a couple of buffalo for sport (7 in 2015), this is one of those Jesuit choices as the hunters pay a crazy amount of money to the state for the privilege.   In any event, tourists and hunters don\u2019t mix; the park closes down for the day. \r\n\r\nBuffalo Roundup\u2014 OCTOBER. The buffalo roundup is held each fall to check the health of the bison herd, give them shots and cull excess bison. They try to limit the herd to between 500 and 700 animals. The roundup puts the extra animals on sale and you can score your own buffalo calf for around $2.50 a pound. There are usually around 200 animals on sale. \r\n\r\nThe Buffalo Roundup is a two-part event consisting of \u201cthe push\u201d where they gather up all of the buffalo and, 5 days later, \u201cthe working\u201d where they give the animals their shots and choose out which animals get culled. \r\n\r\nAntelope Island Ultra-Marathon\u2014MARCH.

Located at 14,400 feet on a glacial moraine, 25 kilometers from the road, it is the staging area for the standard route on Aconcagua.  Growing interest in South America's highest peak means that on any given year, Plaza de Mulas might be larger than the year before.  In January of 2011 there were over two hundred tents.  Plaza de Mulas gets it's name from the mule services which are responsible for bringing the heaviest gear up the mountain.  The mules can carry up to 60 kilos.  Plaza de Mulas is as far as they can go.  For most climbers, Plaza de Mulas serves as the second camp with Confluencia being camp 1, but Mulas is the true base camp.  This is where climbers spend their time between acclimatization hikes and also waiting out bad weather.\r\n\r\nEvening At Camp And Alpenglow On Aconcagua\r\n\r\nOne kilometer across the valley from the main camp, constructed safely away from the moraine, is a large hotel.  Although this building is not heated, it does have many nice services to offer including restaraunt, telephone, internet, post office, showers, gear rental, gas canisters, and porters.  Take a look at their full list.  But the hotel is not the only place to find amenities.  Back in the main camp there are several giant tents set up as restaurants and there are also solar powered huts that sell hot showers.\r\n\r\nThe Hotel\r\n\r\nFor internet service you need only walk as far as the art gallery where Miguel Doura will sell you some time.  Yes, that's right, I said art gallery.  From December to March Miguel Doura lives in his tent, painting and sketching and displaying his work.  He's proud to display a certificate from the Guiness Book of World Records stating that his art gallery is the highest in the world.  Just outside his \"Nautilus\" tent he has the world's second highest web cam.  See his website.\r\n\r\nCuerno Towers Over Plaza de Mulas\r\n\r\nAlthough Aconcagua has a high number of fatalities each year, the medical services and rescue operations are carried out with precision.  There is a medics hut directly across from the rangers hut.  All climbers must pass a physical at the medics hut before being granted permission to climb higher.  Weather forecasts can be found posted on the door of the rangers hut.  Helicopter rescue costs are covered under the initial cost of the climbing permit but the helicopter can only fly as high as Nido des Condores camp at 18,300 feet.  If you are too tired to walk down from Plaza de Mulas after climbing the mountain, you may purchase a ride on the helicopter for $500.\r\n\r\n200 Tents and The Hotel 1 Kilometer Away\r\n\r\nAconcagua is not the only peak which is climbed from Plaza de Mulas.  There are three other peaks which can be climbed.  Bonete is the most popular for acclimatization, But Cerro Catedral and Cuerno are also worthy objectives.  The massive southern glacier on Cuerno is the source of the Horncones River and it's what gives Plaza de Mulas its dramatic backdrop.\r\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/gimpilator/25744\">gimpilator</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=14&amp;distance_14=100&amp;distance_lat_14=-32.64795&amp;distance_lon_14=-70.05636&amp;map_14=1&amp;is_open=1\">32.64795\u00b0S / 70.05636\u00b0W</a>", "Location": "Argentina, South America", "Season": "Summer", "Object ID": "707470", "Created/Edited": "Mar 30, 2011 / Mar 31, 2011", "Object Title": "Plaza de Mulas"},
{"Getting There": "\u00a0By bike...\r\nExit the A23 highway near Gemona and drive to Venzone/Ven\u010d town. Don't forget to have a walk through it! On the northern part you enter the Val Venzonassa. By a narrow mountain road you drive into the valley till the altitude of some 475m, where before the first tunnel there's a parking place. If you want to ascend by the church of San Antonio Abate, you can park on the curve before (some 40 meters higher). At the tunnel the sign stands that the road further into Val Venzonassa is closed for public traffic. But when the agriturismo on Casera Confin is opened, below the sign you will find an inscription (in Italian only), allowing you to drive up on that alpine meadow. The road continues above the Venzonassa valley, above Borgo Prabunello you find a crossroads (towards the east you'd continue on Forca Tacia, 1053m), where you deter left. In many turns the road brings you on the slopes of J\u00f4f di Ungarina, where you take the right branch on Casera Confin, 1331m (the left branch brings you on Casera Ungarina).\r\n\r\nTo walk-up there you need from the tunnel parking place some 2h 30min. When visiting Malga Confin, we were optimistic and took bikes with us. With heavy rucksacks (tent, sleeping bags, food for 2 days) we mostly walked up, but next day the descent was fast. Only that we had to stop several times to cool down brakes. A well trained mountain biker could of course ride up.", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Morning above Malga Confin\r\nIn Julian Pre-Alps there are not many mountain huts. But what is nice, are a few shepherds settlements, which are arranged for tourism. If any of them can be recommended, then it's Agriturismo Malga Confin, a beautiful place above Val Venzonassa. It is remote, yet reachable by a narrow and steep mountain road, the familly, running the premises is exceptionally kind and gentle and Mrs. Gabriela indeed cooks very well. Why not trying a few typical simple, but delicious meals from Carnia? She also speaks several languages, so communication in Friulian, Italian, German and English will be no problem.\r\n\r\nThe settlement lies in a charming saddle on the southern slopes of the main mountain crest, on the place, where below J\u00f4f di Confin a few nice grassy hills rise. I can hardly think of anything more beautiful, than walking up on that grassy hills, fully covered with all kinds of flowers and picturesque trees, waiting for a sunrise, when the world around is flooded by a warm light.\r\n \r\n \r\n\u00a0Sunrise\r\n\u00a0Colourful flowers \r\n\u00a0Cima di Campo \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe nearby alpine meadow is Malga Ungarina, some 1500 meters (20 minutes) away, towards the west.

It belongs to the Monte Rosa massif.\r\n\r\nThe Balmenhorn has a rock summit and is situated southwestern of the Corno Nero on the Lysglacier, on the orographically left side of the Lysglacier. The highest point has a Christstatue \"Christo delle Vette\" which is higher than a normal person. It is made out of bronze. It was created by Alfredo Bai on the 4th of September 1995.

Lieven\r\n\r\nDate: Dec 08, 2001 09:11 AM \r\n\r\nI have read a definition on what can be called a mountain. It says that it is a summit if the height difference between the lower col and the summit is greater than 35 m. \r\nFor the Balmenhorn, this is not the case.  \r\n \r\n3. Rahel Maria Liu\r\n\r\nI have just read in the 3 books, cited above, that the authors count the Balmenhorn as a mountain. But they do not give any reason for this. Therefore this page could be useful as addition to this common option and as a place of discussion of this problem.\r\n\r\nFor further information about this question of \"What is a mountain\" read also Hartmut Bielefeldt\r\n\r\n4.

If he thinks\r\nthat this should be counted as a peak thats good enough for me.\r\n\r\nAlso it is a peak on Peakware:\r\nwww.4-tausender.de/\r\nwww.innominata-mc.org.uk\r\nhjem.get2net.dk\r\nwww.mujweb.cz\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nUlli Prinz \r\n\r\n 5. JScoles\r\n\r\nDate: Dec 18, 2001 4:15 PM \r\nI think it might be best to have one page for Massifs like Mota Rosa, Logan or Kilimanjaro and then use the a route section to show the way to the various peaks. \r\n\r\n6. Rahel Maria Liu\r\n\r\nDate: Dec 19, 2001 01:03 AM \r\nI have thought as well about a way to make it clear, that different summits of one massif belong to this one. One could either use the section \"state/province\" (this would become confused) or really create a new section, which is, if I understand you correctly, one of your options. There should exist 2 sections: 1 for the massif and another 1 for the summits. But then there are two possibilites to add this new section \"massif\": \r\neither on the level of mountains, that means that the name of the massif appears on the list of all mountains, or within every mountainpage, so that every summit of a massif still appears as one mountain, but with the subclassification, to which massif it belongs, in the title passage. \r\n\r\nI have also thought about the route-option. But if if you use this section for the different summits, than you do not have any section any more for the different routes to one of these summits. So in this case, a sub-section for the different routes to each summit of the massif should be created. \r\n \r\n7. om\r\n\r\nDate: Dec 18, 2001 11:37 AM \r\nBalmenhorn is a summit of Monte Rosa even Nordend, Signal Kuppe, Dufourspitze are more important summits. \r\n\r\nMountains are the whole stuff from valley to summit. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "Parking Place": "Free parking is available in Alagna Valsesia\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Oct 27, 2001 / Feb 12, 2006", "Maps": "Schweizer Landeskarten:1:25000 no. 1348 Zermatt\r\n1:50000 no. 5006 Matterhorn-Mischabel\r\n1:50000 no. 284 Mischabel\r\n1:50000 no. 294 Gressoney\r\n(to order at DAV Service)\r\n\r\n", "Books": "Hermann Biner, Hochtouren im Wallis.

{"OVERVIEW": "\n            \u00a0\r\nInside Signal Mountain Campground\r\n\r\nNailing down sleeping arrangements in Grand Teton can be tricky; most of the campsites in Grand Teton National Park are 1st come, 1st served.  The Jenny Lake site is considered the prize, with Signal Mountain and Colter Bay as the runners up.  If all else fails, Gros Ventre almost never fills up but if it does, you can always go primitive at Lizard. \r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nLike 5 of the 6 campgrounds in Grand Teton National Park, Signal Mountain is first come first served. No reservations.  While that gives you the flexibility to come as you like, it also means you have to arrive at the site early during the peak season.  There are 86 camping sites in the campground.  Typically, Signal Mountain fills up well before noon during high summer and just after noon during weekends late spring/early fall. If you are arriving late or the campground is full, the Gros Ventre campground (in the South East of Grand Teton Park) rarely fills to capacity.  Go there and try Signal Mountain the next morning. \r\n\r\nSignal Mountain Campground has several advantages.  It is centrally located in the park  in a forest near Jackson Lake; its central location makes it a good staging point for day-hikes/climbs throughout the park. The individual spots are a little crowded but, since you are in the middle of a pine forest, there is some privacy.  Some sites have views of the lake. The sites are standard government sites (I suppose there\u2019s a regulation somewhere) and come with a fire-pit, grill, picnic table and bear box. The restrooms (flush toilets/no hot water) are scattered throughout the campground but look convenient to all sites.  \r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve never done \u201cFirst Come/First Served\u201d camping, drive up to the campground station. Get one of the cards.  Drive into the campground and look for an open spot. Ones that have already been reserved have a card hanging on the post.  When you find an empty site, fill out the card and hang from the post.  Leave something on the site (chairs, cooler or gear), go back to the station,  put the required money in the envelope and drop into the payment box.  \r\n\r\nHELPFUL HINT: BRING CASH (include small bills so you can drop the correct amount) \r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\nHiking Jenny Lake\r\n\r\nSignal Mountain campground sits directly adjacent to the Signal Mountain store and Marina 16 miles north of Jenny Lake. It opens in May and closes mid-Oct (i.e. 8 May \u2013 18 Oct in 2015).  It is closed all winter. Check the NPS for specific dates as they change from year to year. Check in time is 11 AM and they want you to check out by 10 AM.  The rangers do actually patrol the area and take a count of who\u2019s staying/going every morning. The maximum length of stay is 14 days with no more than 30 days in the park per year.  Cost per night has been bumping up lately but was $22 a night in 2015 ( $45 with electric). \r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable Stuff:\r\n\r\nSignal Mountain Store in walking distance\r\nDump station\r\nWater \r\nGenerators are okay\r\nGas Station nearby (At the Store)\r\n2 Restaurants (At the Store)\r\nGift Store (At the Store)\r\nFirewood (At the Store)\r\nFlush Toilets \r\nBear Boxes\r\nGrills/Fire pit \r\nFishing at Jackson Lake (and you can rent boats)\r\n\r\nLimiting Factors\r\n\r\nNo Showers (nearest ones are at Colter Bay)\r\nNo Laundry (nearest ones are at Colter Bay, next to the showers)\r\nNo gathering firewood (for sale at store)\r\nNot Handicap accessible\r\nNo hot water\r\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/fleshj27/63611\">Fleshj27</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=14&amp;distance_14=100&amp;distance_lat_14=43.84100&amp;distance_lon_14=-110.61500&amp;map_14=1&amp;is_open=1\">43.84100\u00b0N / 110.615\u00b0W</a>", "Hazards/Getting Rescued": "\u00a0\r\nUp on Inspiration Point\r\n\r\nWeather: For camping purposes, spring and fall can be kind of unpredictable.  Although the snow is usually gone by May and hasn\u2019t come yet in Oct, it does get below freezing some nights and/or you might get hit with an unseasonable snow storm.  By summer the biggest weather threat comes from nightly thunderstorms that roll in violently and quickly move on.  Cover your gear for rain even if there\u2019s not a cloud in the sky. Bottom line, pack to unpredictability and check the weather report before leaving your site. \r\n\r\nCell phone service is uneven throughout the park; it cuts out at random intervals.  Because cell phone communication/mapping  isn\u2019t a sure thing, follow the usual precautions of letting someone know where are and when you\u2019ll be back.  You might also want to leave a note in your tent just in case (so the rangers can find you if you\u2019ve been missing for a couple of days).\r\n\r\nPeople have a tendency to be lulled into a sense of security in a National Park but heat, cold, physical exhaustion and disorientation are still a thing in the Tetons. Rescue is uncertain if you don\u2019t take care of yourself.  Drink plenty of water, know your limitations and don\u2019t take off into the forest assuming you won\u2019t get misplaced.  The Boy Scouts have it right\u2026\u201dBe Prepared\u201d.  Your modern equipment will most likely fail at the worst moment.  Most people\u2019s instinct when tired, thirsty and lost is to panic and blindly run in the direction you think is safe\u2026don\u2019t.  Sit down, think and get reoriented. Remember to bring the old-fashioned rescue devices like whistles, lighters, flashlights, mirrors and marking tape. \r\n\r\n\u00a0Deer at campsite\r\n\r\nMegafauna in the Grand Tetons are legion\u2026try not to piss them off by getting in their space.  For non-people eating species (e.g. deer, elk, moose, and bison), stay 25 yards away.  Don\u2019t be fooled into thinking they are big and dumb; they can run like wind and have no problem with goring you.  For the beasts that can plain eat your ass whole (e.g. bears and wolves), the US Government highly recommends staying a full 100 yards away. If you really want that special selfie with a Grizzly, just photoshop yourself into the picture when you get home. \r\n\r\nIn addition, you might want to buy some bear spray on the off-chance distance isn\u2019t the solution to not getting eaten.  It\u2019s not just for bears either; feel free to use it on wolves, cougars, or anything else that is mistaking you for a buffet. \r\n\r\nAnimals even frequent Signal Mountain Campground itself.  There are deer that meander through camp and, even though it\u2019s a clich\u00e9, bears have been known to raid camper\u2019s picnic baskets.  Store food in the Bear Box and don\u2019t hassle the natives.  \r\n\r\n", "Location": "Wyoming, United States, North America", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall", "Object ID": "943410", "Created/Edited": "Jun 19, 2015 / Jun 19, 2015", "Object Title": "Signal Moutain Campground"},

{"Who was Solvay? ": "Originating from Belgium Ernest Solvay (1838-1922) invented the industrial process for sodium carbonate production, from which a world-wide undertaking resulted. He devoted most of his time to his business and it was not until after retirement his alpine career began. He often visited the Walliser and the B\u00fcndner Alpen, the Dolomites and the Mont Blanc region. His companions were the guides Alois Supersaxo from Saas Fee and Martin Schocher from Pontresina. As a gratitude for the unforgettable hours in the mountains, and from the realization that occasionally sudden thunder storms were leading to tragedies, he donated the well-known hut on the H\u00f6rnli Ridge on the Matterhorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0Taking a well earned rest at the Solvay Hut\r\nThe Solvay Hut at 4003 m is the highest hut on the Matterhorn. It is a small emergency refuge for about 10 persons situated on a ledge immediately above the Moseley Slab on the H\u00f6rnligrat. It is strictly to be used in the event of an emergency. About two thirds up the mountain, 743 m above the H\u00f6rnli Hut and 475 m below the summit, many Matterhorn climbers have rested on the small ledge outside the hut admiring the spectacular view of all the Monte Rosa summits.\r\n\r\nThe hut was built in August 1915. All the building material was brought up to the H\u00f6rnli Hut at 3260 m by help of animals. From there a small temporary cable car was used to transport the material up to the building site at 4000 meter. The hut was erected within only five days.

Since the tragedy during the first ascent fourteen years earlier the Matterhorn had claimed no more victims. \r\n\r\nDuring the ascent Moseley insisted on climbing parts of the route unroped but the guides persuaded him not to. At nine in the morning they reached the summit where they stayed for twenty minutes. Again on the descent Moseley wanted to climb without the rope and despite protests from the others he took the rope off. At the steep part below where the Solvay Hut later was erected the accident happened.

It was built by the section Prag of the German and Austrian Mountain Club in 1875. The Owner of the hut is now the CAI Mailand / Milano (Club Alpino Italiano). Payer hut is situated on the exposed North-Ridge of Ortler also known as Tabarettakamm (Tabaretta-Ridge). The hut is the origin for the Ortler on the normal route which takes round about 4 hours to the summit. The hut was named after Knight Julius von Payer an officer and mountaineer born 1842 and died 1915. He made the first ascent of Adamello in 1864 and together with his guide Josef Pinggera several first ascents like Cevedale, Vertainspitze or Monte Zebru.

From this point keep following the path through the forest in a SE direction (don't get confused by multiple options to go, just try to keep the SE direction as good as possible)\r\nYou'll have to cross the main road (see 2.) to Brand multiple times and it can be a little bit hard to find the spot where the path continues.

It is also possible to walk it all the way from Capileira following the gorge of the Poqueira River. Here follows a detailed description of this route:\r\n\r\nTo reach the Poqueira Mountain Hut, at 2.485 m, there is a four and a half hours walk  from the mountain village of Capileira (1.432 m), or even shorter walk when parking the car (there is no public transport to this point) near the \"Poqueira Electric Station\" (1.570 m), a little bit further into the \"Poqueira valley\".\r\n\r\nWhen starting from Capileira there is a path which starts directly from the village (150 meters away from the Town House). Firstly it goes up to an unpaved road that goes down to the houses of 'La Cebadilla' (mostly unhabited) and to the Electric Station. \r\n\r\nFor those ones with car they could have reached this point from the village of Capileira. The road that goes up and out of the village should be followed for, about, 3 kilometers and then take the dusty road to the left (north).\r\n\r\nLeft behind the Electric Station, we walk into the gorge. There is a walking path (to the left) which starts to steeply climb in zigzag till it reaches a 'Cortijo' (traditional house). It goes further in traverse on the left slopes of a deep gorge. Finally, after reaching another 'cortijo', it descends again to the gorge. Here the bottom of the valley is wider and with threes. Crossed this valley the path goes up again in zigzag, leaves the last threes and, after a big stone-pile reaches the last traditional house ('Cortijo de las Tomas'), painted in white. From this point climbs again over a well marked path till the 'Refugio de Poqueira' (UTM coordinates/waypoint: E 0471307 - N 4098180 ~ Datum= Europeo 1950)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Capileira, via 'Acequia Alta'(arab ancient aqueduct) takes from 3 to 4 hours.

First there were scientific reasons, as with a lot of huts, for the construction. But next to research there was a heavy competition between two departments of the German Alpine Club. One called Sektion Mark Brandenburg (founded in 1899) and the other Sektion Berlin (founded in 1869). The deparment in Berlin had already built a lot of huts in the Alps, mostly in the Zillertal Valley. In 1903 the first plans were created for the building of a hut on the Gepatschferner (glacier), in order to open up one of the biggest glacierfields in the East Alps for mountaineers. \r\nThey chose a point on a southern slope (because it was relatively secure for avalanches). This slope is part of the Dahmannspitze (3401m) which is named after the designer of the Brandenburger Haus.\r\n\r\nProfessor Pott from M\u00fcnchen also wanted the built of the hut as he stated in magazine, number 4, of the D.u.\u00d6.A.V. (German and Austrian Alpine Clubs) on February 18, 1903.\r\n\r\n\"Ein Blick auf unsere \u00d6tztaler Karte zeigt uns, wie viele hervorragende Eisgipfel von einem Kesselwandhaus aus mit geringem Aufwand von Zeit und Kraft bestiegen werden k\u00f6nnten, welche gro\u00dfartigen Gletscherwanderungen von dem genannten Punkt nach allen Richtungen, ohne da\u00df man sich anstrengen m\u00fc\u00dfte, ausf\u00fchrbar sind.\"\r\n\r\n(free translation: \"One view on our map of the \u00d6tztaler Alps shows us how many prominent ice summits and wonderfull glacier walks in every direction could be made from a Kesselwand hut, this all without using much time or too much strenght.\")\r\n\r\nThe built that started in 1905 could only continue in the summer, because of height and the cold. All the raw materials had to be dragged from the valley up to the buildingplace for which they used animals and human strenght.\r\nIn 1909 the built was finished and they had put a lot of effort in it. The costs of the built were about 47.000 Goldmark and creating new paths added another 40.000 Mark. The opening was from 15 to 18 August, first in Vent (1896m) and next in the hut.\r\n\r\nThe Brandenburger Haus in the 20th century\r\nDuring the First World War the Brandenburger Haus was used by the army of Austria, to train mountain divisions in skiing (from 1915 to 1918). This period wasn't that good for the hut. The militairy use of it damaged several parts of it and they polluted the surroundings of the hut by throwing their refuse into the glacier crevasses.\r\n\r\nThe hut was after the war back in the hands of Mark Sektion Brandenburg and it opened its doors again for tourist in 1920. The levels of mountaineers on the hut varied, especially when the German National Socialist party was in power. The nature of the Sektion Brandenburg was also quite anti semetic (jews could not join) and therefore it was banned by the allied forces after the Second World War. \r\n\r\nAfter the Second World War the hut was owned by the province of Tirol under French supervision they decided to sent the famous Martin Busch to the hut. \r\nIn 1956 the German Alpine Club got back all their huts in the Alps. The renewed department in Berlin took care of the hut and they had to do a lot of work on the hut, because it had fallen into decay. \r\n\r\nIn 1997 is the whole hut environmentally reorganized and cleaned. It could now regulate their own water and energy supply. Food and other materials are nowadays transported by helicopter.\r\n\r\n                                          "},

{"Access Routes": "\nNumbers refer to Ojstrica routes, not to Kocbekov dom ascent routes!1. From Kamni\u0161ka Bistrica\nMarked, medium hard hike-up, 4 h. See also the description here. The trailhead is in Kamni\u0161ka Bistrica valley, 1 km before the big parking place at the mountain hut. We enter the Kamni\u0161ka Bela valley where the main road crosses the creek, which has at this point a nice waterfall. The altitude is only 571 m. A comfortable path leads into Kamni\u0161ka Bela in the NE direction. Close to the point, where the path starts to climb steeper, we can also visit a nice waterfall, called Orglice (if the creek has enough water). Our path goes in many turns upwards, allways in the NE direction, until it reaches the Presedljaj (saddle), 1613 m. Till here 2.5 to 3 hours. On the other side of the mountain ridge our path now goes more in a northern direction. We move high above the valley of Lu\u010dka Bela, ascending only moderately, until we reach the Prag (saddle), 1910 m. From there we descend 100 m on a broad green Koro\u0161ica plateau, where the hut stands.\n\nThe direct ascent over \u0160raj peski is much harder.\n\n2. From Lu\u010dka Bela\nMarked, easy hike-up, 3h. From Podvolovljek valley we drive towards the west into the side valley of Lu\u010dka Bela. The mountain road ends on a parking place on some 1080 m, the place is called \"Za loncem\" (because of a nice rocky 'pot' in the nearby creek). From there, the marked path goes northwards by the valley. There are valley steps and more flat parts, but we steadilly gain altitude. After Vratca, 1655 m, a nice ex pasture appears. It is called Stare Stale, a charming place with a small pond. We continue northwards, until the valley closes and the marked path leads us a bit left towards Prag, 1910 m. There we hit the path #1, coming from Presedljaj. To the hut we have now only a short descent.\n\n3. From Below Podve\u017eak\nMarked, easy hike-up, 2 h. This is the shortest and easiest approach, also the most recommendable one in winter. From Podvolovljek valley we drive up by a mountain road on Dleskov\u0161ka planota (plateau). See the main page of Kamnik & Savinja Alps for more details. On the crossroads, we take the left branch, which brings us to the parking place below Podve\u017eak alpine meadow, 1440 m. There's a big pano with many inscriptions about trails. To Podve\u017eak alpine meadow we can walk by a road (closed for public traffic) or by a marked path. From the meadow we continue in the N direction. The path is well marked and goes by a broad valley. From a broad saddle we descend a bit to a small meadow (Inkret), where the path has already the NW direction. After another ascent we are on the upper part of the plateau. By several flat valleys, the terrain is typical karstic, we continue towards the NW. Finally we reach a saddle below Beli vrh (on the left) and start descending slightly. Crossing the slopes above Moli\u010dka planina (meadow) we reach Sedelce (saddle), 1900m. From there towards the W, down on Koro\u0161ica meadow and to the hut.      \n4. From Ravne meadow\nMarked, easy hike-up, 2 h 30 min. This approach starts even a bit higher than the one below Podve\u017eak, but is also a bit longer. From Podvolovljek valley we drive up by a mountain road on Dleskov\u0161ka planota (plateau). See the main page of Kamnik & Savinja Alps for more details. On the crossroads, we take the right branch, which brings us to the parking place on Ravne alpine meadow, 1500 m. From there we continue northwards by a good, marked path. When it passes the summit of Dleskovec (on the left), it starts turning and finally gets the western and even south-western direction. So we ascend Sedelce, 1840 m, between the summits of Dleskovec and Veliki vrh. From there we continue towards the SW, all the way around Veliki vrh, and then towards the NW on Prag (saddle), 1870 m. There are ups and downs on this route and also the continuation is similar. The marked path brings us towards the NW on Moli\u010dka planina (meadow) and towards the west up again on Sedelce, 1900 m. There we join the route #3, descend on Koro\u0161ica meadow and continue to the hut.\n\n5. From Robanov Kot\nMarked, strenuous and in a few places quite exposed, marked path. 4 h. See the more detailed description also here. The trailhead is at Roban's farm, 700 m - see the main page of Kamnik & Savinja Alps for more details. A decent macadam road goes through the beautiful valley till its end, to Robanova planina (pasture). From there you follow the marked path, which soon starts turning a bit towards left, then crosses two ravines and finally reaches steep and rocky slopes of Velika Zelenica. In spring and early summer here's a snow field and a weak waterfall. From the waterfall the marked trail ascends steeper, allways keeping right of a big ravine. When reaching walls, it goes right again, well marked and protected. Using a few narrow and exposed ledges as the most natural passages, ascending also directly upwards, we come over the rocky part in an hour. In next few minutes we reach over grassy slopes the saddle, cca 1750m. Now we are on the northern edge of Dleskov\u0161ka planota carst plateau. The marked path leads us horizontally towards the west, soon we reach Moli\u010dka planina, where on the edge a small hut and chapel stand. We don't need to go just to the hut, but proceed westwards. The path starts to ascend slowly again, leading us around Mala Ojstrica to Sedelce and further down to Kocbekov dom.\n\n6. From the Kamni\u0161ko sedlo\nMarked, medium hard, protected path, partly exposed. 3 h. From the hut we go towards the E, till the path reaches the W wall of Planjava. Then it first crosses a fine scree field and further on starts ascending by narrow, crumbly bands across the slope. Wherever needed, the path is protected, but requires a safe step and clear head anyway. The direction is SE. At the end of crossing, the path reaches Sukavnik, 2100 m, a grassy balcony in the south ridge of Planjava. Now the path starts continuing crossing the grassy S slopes of Planjava. It goes all the time towards Srebrno sedlo (Silver Saddle), 2115 m. (To ascend Planjava, we should deter left soon after Sukavnik, and also from Srebrno sedlo a path goes on top). From Srebrno sedlo we now need only to descend towards the east to Kocbekov dom. This part is easy and not exposed any more.\n\nIf we ascend the summit of Planjava (by any of the two south routes), we can continue by the main ridge towards the east. Also this path is marked, but again on a few places quite steep and narrow. It goes over the picturesque summit of Lu\u010dka Brana (Baba) on \u0160karje notch, where it joins the path, coming from the north, from Logarska dolina (#7 below). From \u0160karje notch we descend towards Kocbekov dom in the SE direction in less than 1 hour. Coming from Kamni\u0161ko sedlo, this route is some 30 minutes longer, but we take also the summit of Planjava and the route is more beautiful.\n\n7. From Logarska dolina\nMarked, long and strenuous ascent over \u0160karje notch, 5h. See the more detailed description also here. From Logarska dolina (valley) you first ascend by a marked path to Ko\u010da pod Ojstrico (hut), 1208 m. 1h. From there we continue towards the S, crossing through a forrest the western slopes of Kroficka. On the altitude of 1480 m, 30 min from the hut, there is the path branching. Our '\u0160karje Notch' route is easier and goes right. We cross the slopes below Ojstrica's N face towards the SW, towards the passage between Ojstrica and Rjav\u010dki vrh, 1898 m. By a steep scree we ascend towards the S we, then the path crosses towards the SW and at the end even towards the W again and we reach the saddle below Rjav\u010dki vrh. The altitude is a bit more than 1800 m. Here the path turns left, aiming to the notch in the main ridge. In many turns it is winding up the scree slope. Finally the last meters below \u0160karje notch are more steep, but we reach the sunny side without any problems. A well deserved grassy balcony is awaiting us to take some rest. Down to Kocbekov dom we have now less than 1 hour more.\n\n8. From Mala planina or Velika planina\nMarked, a medium hard, partially exposed and artificially protected path, 4h. The route from mala and Velika planina goes over the summit of Konj, 1803 m. See here the description. From alpine meadows we go all the time towards the north. From the summit of Konj, down on Presedljaj pass the path is narrow, protected and exposed. On Presedljaj we hit the path #1 and continue by it over Prag to the hut.", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/vid-pogachnik/2279\">Vid Pogachnik</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=14&amp;distance_14=100&amp;distance_lat_14=46.35565&amp;distance_lon_14=14.63973&amp;map_14=1&amp;is_open=1\">46.35565\u00b0N / 14.63973\u00b0E</a>", "Summits and Passages": "From Kocbekov dom, you can go further to:\n\nSummits> Lu\u010dki Dedec, 2023 m, 1 h,\n> Ojstrica, 2350 m, 1 h 30 min,\n> Planjava, 2394 m, 2 h,\n> Veliki vrh, 2110 m, 1 h 30 min.\n...And other summits above Dleskov\u0161ka planota, like: Tolsti vrh, Deska, Lastovec, Dleskovec...\n\nPassages> To Kamni\u0161ko sedlo, 1864 m, 3 h.\n> To Mala planina or Velika planina, 1526 m, 4 h.", "Location": "Slovenia, Europe", "Overview": "\n            \nDedec above Koro\u0161ica meadow - the hut is on the right\nOjstrica above Kocbekov domIn Slovenian language \u010d, \u0161 and \u017e are pronounced like ch, sh, and zh. The meadow, where the hut stands, is Koro\u0161ica (meaning: 'The Carinthian').\n\nKocbekov dom is standing on the western edge of a big, completely horizontal alpine meadow, called Koro\u0161ica, on the altitude of 1808 m. It is named by Fran Kocbek (1863-1930), the deserved initiator and organiser of mountaineering in Savinjska dolina.\n\nThe first hut was built in 1876 by a German-Austrian mountaineering club, but in 1881 it burned down. In 1882 a new hut was built. After the World War I, the hut was taken over by 'Savinjska podru\u017enica' - a part of Slovenian Mountaineering Organisation, after which it was several times renewed. During the World War II, the hut was taken over by the German Alpine Club and after the war Celje Mountaineering Club (Planinsko dru\u0161tvo Celje Matica) is running it. Major renewals were done again in 1973 and in 2003.\n\nJust above the hut, the southern face of Ojstrica is rising. But due to its strategic point, Kocbekov dom serves more than only the ascents on Ojstrica. It is a crossroads of many hikes, a home for climbers, who challenge the hard routes in the nearby Dedec in Ve\u017eica and in winter and spring also a welcomed refuge for tour skiers.\n\nThe hut is opened from mid June till mid September.

{"History of Priut 11": "\u00a0\u00a0A group of climbers were cooking meal in August of 1998 in Priut 11, a mountain hut sometimes called the highest hotel in the world. Although it housed 120 visitors the hut only had a tiny cramped kitchen with one gas cooker. As a result the climbers were using their own stove. The stove started to burn, and someone poured some liquid from a nearby container on it thinking it was a water, but no - it was a fuel! Several people suffered slight injuries, one person was seriously cut after abseiling from an upper window and breaking glass. You can still see remains of this structure on the slopes on Elbrus. The main route goes by it. \r\n\r\nPriut 11 was constructed in 1929, originally as a small hut, at an altitude of 4160 meters (the refuge of 11 - named after 11 scientists who had earlier used that site as their base). In 1932, a larger Priut was constructed on the same site. The hut accommodated 120 visitors, had an electricity, and was totally weather proof.\r\n\r\nIn 1942, the Germans were desperate for fuel, and tried to reach the oil in the Caspian Sea. A unit of the German Alpine division \"Edelweiss\" arrived unexpectedly at Priut 11, so the swastika was flying over there as well.\r\nSince the demise of the Priut 11 the rubble and charred remains have been mainly cleared up and a new hut - Diesel Hut - has been built on the same site. Most people stay at the Barrels, Diesel Hut is more like an alternative - less privacy, no heating, no electricity. Camping is available in the vinicity of Diesel Hut.

After some damage, the camp was completely rebuilt in 1961, in wood and sheet metal photo.\n\nThe old bivouac\u00a0\u00a0\nThe new bivouac\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, after 40 years since the last rebuilding, and during the 60 years anniversary of the \"National School of skimountaineering\", the SUCAI has decided to build a new structure to replace the existing one.\n\nThe new hut is built with a modular chassis in sandwich composite and internally organized into 2 areas (the dining room, and dormitory with 12 beds) for a total of thirty square meters of 1980 pounds. It is designed to be built entirely in the valley, air dispatch and installed with minimal field operations.\u00a0\nThis constructive approach derived from the nautical and aeronautical experience, will allow the new camp to resist more over time under conditions of high altitude.\nThe electrical energy is produced by photovoltaic units with accumulators of the latest generation. Will run a dedicated system of diagnosis and detection of internal and external environmental data, and a call for help.\u00a0The bivouac is equipped with a PC with internet connection 24h.

{"Overview": "\n            \u00a0\nTypical Arches CampsiteIn camper\u2019s world, Devil\u2019s Garden Campground is the hot, hard-to-get ticket.  It\u2019s iconic. It\u2019s limited spacing.  If it were in New York it\u2019d have a red rope and a couple of goons standing in front.  It\u2019s listed as one of the world\u2019s most desired camping locations and it\u2019s yours for the low, low price $18 a night.  Money alone, however, won\u2019t get you into this campsite; to score the world-renown campsites at Devil\u2019s Garden, you need to have internet access and grey matter enough to plan 6 months out.  \nDevil\u2019s Garden Campground is located 18 miles from the entrance of Arches National Park which is about 5 miles north of Moab.  To get to the campsite, you get to drive the entire length (of paved roads) through Arches National Park.  It can be annoying at times because it\u2019s highly likely you\u2019ll get stuck behind a gawky driver doing 10 miles under the speed limit with their blinker on.  That\u2019s okay, you are slo-mo\u2019ing through God\u2019s own canvass---it is spectacular. \n\nThe campground designers did a pretty good job of making the sites semi-secluded in a crowded area. Most sites have some sort of shade tree or at least a big rock to further isolate the site.  All campsites include a picnic table, fire pit and grill.  Firewood can be bought from the camp host for cheap.  Two restrooms (no showers) with running water/flush toilets are located in the camp ground.  On the downside, you need to check out where your site is when you reserve, pick the wrong spot and you are looking at a quarter mile round trip bathroom to tent. Potable water is available in the campground.    \n\nThe campsite itself is worth the price of admission. It is located in a semi-forested desert with Utah Juniper and pinion pines.  There\u2019s yucca, sage brush, prickly pear and, if you show up right after a rain storm, bunches of wildflowers.  The land-scape in the area has a \u201cFred Flintstone\u201d look to it with sandstone jutting out into odd shapes.  The rocks are cool looking, all the colors vibrant reds and yellows, and the desert sunsets in the camp beautiful.    \n\nLimiting Factors:\n\nNo showers\nNo RV Dumpsites\nNo electrical hookups\nNo Grocery store for 30 miles\nNot Pet friendly\u2026few places you can bring a dog\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/fleshj27/63611\">Fleshj27</a>", "Hazards": "", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=14&amp;distance_14=100&amp;distance_lat_14=38.77356&amp;distance_lon_14=-109.58635&amp;map_14=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.77356\u00b0N / 109.58635\u00b0W</a>", "Getting There/Resupply/Reservations": "\u00a0\nGo ahead and Gawk...everyone else is!From I-70, take US 191 South toward Moab.  5 miles before Moab, you\u2019ll see a large sign for Arches National Park.  Drive in, pay the $10.  Follow the main road for 18 miles. Camp entrance is just before the Primitive Trial parking lot.  \n\nWARNING! \n\nDO NOT blindly follow Bing or Google Maps if you aren\u2019t familiar with the area! For instance Bing directions Arches to Canyonlands will send you on a 7 hour trip, 150 miles out of your way.  It\u2019s actually only 48 miles and less than an hour.  Computer directions will also needlessly show you crossing dirt roads to get to Arches National Park and are completely convoluted.  Google and Bing are not to be trusted in this area for some reason.  Consult a real map before taking off. \n\nResupply\n\nCamping in Arches is a come as you are party; resupply inside the park is limited and to get anything more than water you\u2019ll end up going to stores in Moab.  As a result, grocery runs involve a 50 mile round trip drive.  Preparation is key.\nThe only resupply assets immediately available inside the park are water and firewood.  Everything else from matches to sandwich materials has to be brought in with you. \n\nReservations \n\nYou have to reserve the campsites during the peak season (March \u2013 October).  You can\u2019t reserve more than 240 days in advance, but I do recommend calling 239 days before your trip. These sites fill up FAST! \n\nYou make reservations either by phone or online reservations through www.recreation.gov  or call 877-444-6777.  There are 50 campsites and 2 group sites available. Campsites are $18 a night (2015) for a regular site.  Entry into the park is a ridiculously reasonable $10 for seven days. \n\nIf you strike out, Canyonlands National Park is first come-first served.

And specially for any climber-to-be of Wildspitze. It's formed by a couple of buildings that compose a three storey complex placed on the southern slopes of \u00d6tztaler Urkund on the valley known as Venttal. The lower storey is almost fully occupied by a small hall, the hut reception facility, a storeroom (\"trockenraum\" in german), the kitchen and a warm wooden-decorated dining hall. The upper levels of the hut are dedicated to sleeping rooms (mainly small private rooms for three or four people) and there's an additional space under the roof for a \"matratzenl\u00e4ger\" (that's the term for a big common sleeping room for many sleeping bags on mattresses).

Drive westwards from Innsbruck until you reach the exit of the highway marked as \"\u00d6tztal\". That's where you enter the valley of \u00d6tz, known some years ago because of the finding of a neolithic mummified corpse (\"\u00d6tzi\") somewhere in the upper glaciers. Keep driving south until you pass by S\u00f6lden. Shortly afterwards, take the road to your right marked \"Vent\" and keep going until you reach the end of the road. There's not a lot of parking space in Vent, you might need to leave the car at the entrance of the village. From that point on, it's a three hour walk going uphill. First thing to do is to reach the Stablein restaurant (a path winds uphill under the ski chairlift) and after that a wide dirt track leads across the river formed by the Rofenkarferner and up to the hut.\r\n\r\nInformation by dmiki(March 2010):\r\nIn winter conditions, just after crossing the small bridge over the Rofenkarferner river it might be a good idea to loop left before heading up the ridge and towards the hut. Otherwise, the terrain under the hut can be rather avalanche prone.\r\n\r\nClimbs around the area: Wildspitze (3770 m), Hinterer Brochkogel (3635 m), \u00d6tztaler Urkund (3556 m), Urkundkolm (3134 m), Wildes M\u00e4nnle (3019 m)\r\n\r\nOpening period: The hut is open from mid-June to the end of September.

{"Access Routes": "Jezersko resort is accessible by the road, which connects Slovenia (Kranj) and Austria (Eisenkappel) over jezersko sedlo. From that road a mountain road deters towards the S, passes a small lake and goes into the valley till the parking place, where the lower station of both material cable cars stands. There are the trailheads for both mountain huts on the northern side of this group.\r\n\r\nFrom Ravenska Ko\u010dna by 'Lovska pot' - Hunters path\r\nFrom the parking place (1080m) follow the marked path which goes left of the material cable car, first through the forrest and then soon by the edge of a huge ravine, filled with screes. When reaching the steep part, the part overcomes a few rocky steps and is on those parts also protected by pegs and cables. In switchbacks we ascend directly up, towards the left we see on one or two places into the deep gorge below Velika Baba. Later the path crosses towards the right, reaches more open terrain and again ascends by a shallow ravine just to the hut. 1h 30min.\r\n\r\nThis is the easiest of the ascent routes. In good conditions it can be partly, or even entirely also skied down, but the ski descent is hard. We used to ski also into the ravine below Velika Baba, but only if there was enough snow and really a minimal danger of avalanches.\r\n\r\nFrom Ravenska Ko\u010dna by 'Slovenska pot' - Slovenian path\r\nFrom the big parking place this path goes between both cable cars, first through a forrest, later over a dwarf-pine terrain.  So we reach the ravine, where in the upper part \u017drelo is situated. Below is the crossing of paths. The Slovenian path goes left and climbs over an open rocky wall. This part is well protected, so it is a short medium hard ferrata. Above, the path goes through dwarf pines again, more or less directly upwards. From the right the path through \u017drelo joins. From there, we have only a few minutes to the hut. 1h 30min.\r\n\r\nFrom Ravenska Ko\u010dna through '\u017drelo' ravine\r\nAs by 'Slovenska pot', described above, till the crossing of paths, below \u017drelo ravine. There we continue by the ravine upwards. The ravine becomes more and more steep, and also we should take care of a possibility of falling rocks. In early summer, in the upper part of the ravine there can be a snow field. There the path turns left and ascends even more steeply. That part is protected by steel cables. Finally we climb over the exit wall, walk up to the crossroads, where the Slovenian path joins from the left and continue to the hut. Consider that protection devices on this route can be in some seasons damaged by avalanches and rockfalls and that the route can be harder in such a season. Otherwise it's a medium hard protected route with some objective danger.", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Basic Data": "\n            \u00a0Jezersko resort\u00a0'Glacier' below Skuta\r\nKranjska ko\u010da na Ledinah (also: Vadinah), 1700m, is standing on a terrace above the end of Ravenska Ko\u010dna valley, below the northern walls of the central part of Kamnik and Savinja Alps.

Today there are only rests of it, but in spring and early summer the snow field is big enough to offer a ski fun.

It is situated on a little hill amidst a great mountain scenery, with Mont Blanc de Cheilon dominating the mountain scene.  \n\nTo get to the hut there are different possible acces routes. The two main routes are from Arolla (2000m, Val d'H\u00e9rens) via Pas de Ch\u00e8vres (2855m) to the hut, or from the Barrage de Dixence and the Lac des Dix (Val d'H\u00e9r\u00e9mence). (maps: 1346: Chanrion (1/25000) or 283 Arolla (1/50000))\n\nThe first route starts in Arolla at 2000m and goes to Pas des Ch\u00e8vres at 2855m or to the Col de Riedmatten (2919m). Only from Pas de Ch\u00e8vres or from Col de Riedmatten one can see the Hut. 2-3 hours to this point. When going via Pas de Ch\u00e8vres (as most people do) one has to descend to the Glacier de Cheilon via its famous stairs. 25 vertical meters are thus descended (specially when heavily packed or in bad weather it is safer to descend them secured as one slip can be fatal). A little bit further the path from the Col de Riedmatten (which one can take instead of the Pas de Ch\u00e8vres) joins the path to the hut. This way is however not recommended as for the big danger of falling rocks while descending from the Col to the Glacier. \nAfter reaching the Glacier there's still about one hour to go to the hut. The last part crosses (the remaining of) the Glacier de Cheilon. Finally there's one last steep bit before one reaches the Cabane de Dix. \nIn total one can count on 3h30 to 4h30 from Arolla to the Hut. \n\n\u00a0\nCabane des Dix from Pas de Ch\u00e8vres\n\nThe second main acces route commence at the Barrage de Dixence (2365m). The path follows the Lac des Dix untill the end, passing the little hamlet La Barma. \nAt the end of the lake you have to go over the Pas du Chat (2372m) after which you have to follow the left bank of the Glacier de Cheilon (not crossing the glacier). Finally you go round T\u00eate Noir (a little peak behind the hut at 2981m) before arriving at the hut after about 4h-4h30. \n\nOther possible acces routes are from the Cabane de Chanrion (2462m) over the Col de Tsofeiret (2628m), the Col de lire Rose (3115m), the Col du Mont Rouge (3326m), crossing de Glacier du Gi\u00e9tro, and finally over the Col de Cheilon (3237m).\nAnother route is from the Barrage du Mauvoisin (1976m), over the Col du Gi\u00e9tro (3107m), the Glacier du Gi\u00e9tro and the Col de Cheilon to the Cabane des Dix. \nThese routes are however high alpine routes and can't be made without the appropriate glacier equipment (crampons, piolet, rope,...). \n", "Information about the hut": "Open in summer as well as spring (tourskiing).\nThis year (2016) the hut is open from June 25th till october 1st. \n\n120 places\n\nPrices:\n\n- 67 CHF, demi-pension (for members of an alpine club).\n- 82 CHF, demi-pension (for non-members).\n\nWinterroom: 16 places\n\nReservations have to be made:\n\nOnline reservations:\u00a0http://www.alpenonline.ch/reservation/calendar?hut_id=10\n\nT\u00e9l\u00e9phone/Fax cabane : 0041(0)27.281.15.23\nT\u00e9l\u00e9phone priv\u00e9 gardien : +41 79 197 31 14\n\nE-mail:\u00a0info@cabanedesdix.ch\u00a0(not for reservations)\nE-mail Gardien:\u00a0cabanedesdix@gmail.com\nwww.cabanedesdix.ch\n\n\nview from the Cabane des Dix", "Location": "Switzerland, Europe", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/koenvl/43028\">KoenVl</a>", "Object ID": "731910", "Object Title": "Cabane des Dix"},

This hut is run by the AMC (Appalachian Moutain Club) and is the highest of all their huts in the White Mountains located at an elevation of 5,050ft. on the saddle between Mt. Washington and Mt. Monroe.  The hut takes its name from the two high alpine lakes situated just to the east.  These supply the hut and its inhabitants with a water supply throughout the hut season.  These two lakes are very often easily confused as it seems that they sometimes run into the sky and mix with the clouds.  \r\n\r\nThe hut was built in 1915 and stands next to the largest of the two lakes.  Lakes of the Clouds stands as a very important shelter for those traveling the wind and weather battered northwest slopes of Mt. Washington and the Presidential Range.  It offers hikers protection in the unforgiving weather that this range is notorious for.  The most common, or easiest way of reaching the hut is via the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail.

The route is rarely chosen, especially when compared to H\u00f6rnli ridge on the Swiss side and the crowds you are bound to meet there. Technically it said to be a bit more demanding but offers the best rock on this mountain (though the best here should be by no means mistaken with good).\r\nDue to major rockfalls the hut was not safe in the year 2006, but as far as I know everything is fine now.\r\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Created/Edited": "Aug 6, 2007 / Sep 26, 2007", "How to get there": "The route starts in Italian town Cervinia, not the nicest place.

There are airports at Pau and Toulouse. \r\n\r\nOn the Spanish side, travel by road from Pamplona to the west of the region via the N240 / N330 and the N260 to Torla then via a short local road to Bujaruelo or from Zaragoza south of the region via the N330 to Huesca and then the N260 to Torla. Airports at Pamplona and Zaragoza serve the area.\r\nFrom Bujaruelo, a day's hike over the pass (932 metre climb) at Puerto de Bujaruelo will lead down to the Col du Tents where the road continues on to Gavarnie.\r\n\r\nFor those who aspire to travel with a very low carbon footprint, there are two long distance paths that pass close to Gavarnie, GR10 in France and GR 11 in Spain.  \r\n                                     ", "Things to do": "\u00a0\r\nVignemale from El Taillon\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe Cirque de Gavarnie\r\n\u00a0\r\nHorses on Holiday\r\n\u00a0\r\nEl Taillon & Gabieto\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe trail from Col du Tents to the Frontier\r\nThe Holle refuge is ideally placed to do the ascent of Vignemale, the highest peak in the French Pyrenees.

Neither the heighest in the range of Gorce, these small mountains. But perhaps the most intimate, warm, and beautiful.\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1977 following an order of the PTTK federation, it was designed by experts according to the vision of the Zakopane style, conjugated with the fashions of that time: understand geometric, but full of architectural details from the region.

The most romantic place to sleep in is perhaps the top double-room with the balcony. Worth to mention: one is allowed to pitch a tent in front of it for few zlotys.

It is just over the upper forest limit, in a scenery made of endless grassy undulating pastures, dwarf pines and sherperd huts. Geographically, the hut is almost at the centre of the range, and provides the feeling of being in the heart of a wild remote place.\r\n\r\nDespite a massive appearance at first sight, the dark square-shaped building immediately reveals a friendly and welcoming character, as we reach the other side, facing the slope of Bori\u0161ov. The entrance is decorated humouristicaly with various objects (like the famous shoes !), and so is the rest of the hut.\r\n\r\nThe wooden furnitures that make all the inside are clean and modern, and the dining room well decorated with miscellaneous objects, like wooden tools, ceramics, all related to the mountain lifestyle of the region, and reminds somehow of some folk museum of the Liptov county.\r\n\r\nThe hut can welcome up to 20 people in comfortable rooms, equiped with superposed double-beds. Unfortunately the bar doesn't provide much catering facilities, only basic stuff like sandwhiches, bacon, sausages, omelet. It is recommended to bring a bit extra food (However, surprisingly, the hut is well furbished with local beers and liqueurs like Slivovica, Borovi\u010dka or Dem\u00e4novska !)\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons of it, is that the hut is not served at all by any land-rover track (have you noticed there is not a single corner with dodgy material constructions and odd things ?). Chata pod Bori\u0161ovom belongs to the familly of the slovak huts served by men, the \"\u0160erpas\", and is the only one of this kind out of the Low and High Tatras. The wooden platform-rucksack one can often see in the entrance witnesses it ! The \"Chatars\" regularly take part to the famous Sherpa competition organized yearly in the Tatras.\r\n\r\nGuests can admire the sunset through the windows, from this ideal location. The last rays of light illuminate a whole range of tops including Rakytov, \u010cierny kame\u0148, the massive Plosk\u00e1, Such\u00fd Vrch, Ostredok, Kri\u017ena... The most reckless will perhaps head to the top of Bori\u0161ov some 30mn before the sunset (or the sunrise ?), in order to have a wider panorama.\r\n\r\nWhen the darkness comes, the room is lightened with genuine petrol lamps. When it is a bit cold, the fireplace warms the whole building. Guitars can be found in the main room as well and it is not rare that someone, in the evening, plays some local melody. And perhaps you will also enjoy the company of the friendly german shepherd of the hut, a skillful avalanche dog despite his naive face.\r\n\r\nAll of this make the place very peaceful and relaxing, with a magic atmosphere. I have personally never experienced a hut with such character, except perhaps Teryho Chata in the Tatras. The webmaster of the site Hiking.sk, thanks to which I decided to give it a visit (see the also description page of this site, with many other photos), describes it as the \"best hut in Slovakia\".

The hut offers two of the most breathtaking views in the Alps, to the north side green pastoral landscapes with the village Grindelwald far below, and to the south side massive glaciers and mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Mittellegigrat was first ascended 10 September 1921 by the Japanese Yoko Maki together with the three local guides Fritz Amatter, Samuel Brawand, and Fritz Steuri. Maki donated a sum of 10.000 Franken for a hut to be built near the place where they spent the night prior to their ascent. The hut  built  in 1924 had room for 16 persons.\r\n\r\nA steel pipe bivouac hut was built in 1986 a few meters from the old hut offering room for further 14 persons.\r\n\r\nIn 2001 after 77 years the first Mittellegi Hut was replaced by a new larger hut with 40 beds. The old hut was moved to a location close to the railway station Eigergletscher and now serves as a small museum.\r\n\r\nSince 1995 the Mittellegi Hut has a resident guardian during July and August.

{"Resupplying": "\u00a0\nWest Rim Hiking\n\nRe-provisioning arrangements for extended expeditions are excellent at Watchman. The campsite is located within walking distance (a 2 minute walk) of Springdale which has most assets available for resupply including 2 grocery stores, a gas station, and emergency services. There is a convenient shuttle that frequently runs (every 15 minutes) from the park to downtown and back.\n\nSpringdale also has a large array of restaurants, bars, and shopping available. \n\nWithin the park, water is available at the Zion\u2019s Visitors Center, at the restroom buildings in the campsite and at several of the shuttle stops inside the park. The only dining facility available inside the park is at the Zion Lodge stop; two restaurants \u201cThe Red Rock\u201d (sit down dining) and the \u201cCastle Dome Caf\u00e9\u201d (snack bar). \n", "Getting There": "\n            Overview\u00a0\nTypical Campsite\nNote: Zion National Park is a crazy busy place with over 3 million visitors a year\u2026With that kind of volume, you need to nail down your sleeping arrangements well in advance. Cheap, comfortable and convenient, Watchman Campground is an ideal launch point for doing the Tour De Zion. \n\nOverview\n\nZion National Park is an absolutely stunning example of American Southwest landscape and is one of the most visited places in America. Anyone from outside of the area can expect to see sights they\u2019ve never seen before. \nA shorthand tour of Zion on the tour shuttle will only take most of a day; to see it in detail can take multiple days or even weeks. With that in mind, Zion National Park\u2019s Watchman Camping area provides a great option for a multiple-day stay. Watchman is located directly adjacent to the park shuttle (about a 2 minute walk) and it is also very conveniently located to hop the shuttle to get into Springdale. The campsite itself has a direct view of the Watchman Peak which is an outstanding backdrop to wake up to in the morning. \n\nCampsites at Watchman can be reserved well in advance which is essential to making base camp arrangements. The other campsite in Zion Park, South Campground, operates on a first come, first serve and fill up in the early morning during peak seasons. The reservation system for Watchman avoids that hassle and ensures you have a place to stay during your entire visit. \nThere are 176 total camping sites at Watchman which includes 18 tent \u201cwalk in\u201d, and 95 sites that have electricity available. \n\nFacilities at each site include:\n\nFire Pits --- bring your own wood (you can buy some in Springdale) \nPicnic Tables\nParking for 1 vehicle (except Tent Walk In\u2026but the parking lot is nearby)\nRoom for up to three small tents or one large one\n\nMost of the sites have a shade tree but partial and full sun does hit the sites\n\nFacilities in the campground include\n\nPotable water\nFlush toilets\nSink to brush your teeth\nSink to wash dishes\nElectrical hookups for RV sites (none on tent sites)\n\nLimiting Factors:\n\nNo Showers (available hotels in Springdale)\nNo Sewage disposal for RVs\nNo Firewood gathering (available grocery stores in Springdale)\nGenerator use is prohibited\n\u00a0\nTypical Campsite\nFrom the south (Las Vegas/St. George): Head North to Exit 16, Go East on State Route 9 for 32 miles (watch out for speed traps!) --- Follow the signs for Zion National Park through Springdale.

You might also want to leave a note in your tent just in case (so the rangers can find you if you\u2019ve been missing for a couple of days).\n\nThe 10,000 foot altitude can play merry hell with you in the form of altitude sickness.  If you get headachy, chronically short of breath or have other altitude related issues you may reconsider your sleeping arrangements.  \n\nWheeler Peak creates its own weather\u2026how cool is that? With the weather creation comes wind and lots of it. In addition to localized wind, you get rain when there isn\u2019t rain anywhere else and snow when it seems most unlikely. Check the weather specific to Great Basin National Park (Baker is located a good 5,000 feet lower). Be sure to bring the whole battery of clothes and heating devices even in the summer\u2014shorts and a tank top probably won\u2019t cut it. Bottom line: you need to prepare for most weather related contingencies. A call to the ranger station may be helpful before going. \n\n\u00a0\nHiking the Glacier\n\nGreat Basin animals tend to be the non-people eating type---no bear boxes provided.   That being said, there are several species that can inflict severe bodily harm if annoyed to include coyotes, cougars, and badgers.  The most common threat, however, is the multitude of small ravenous critters that\u2019ll shred your $962 Shelby Glamping Tent to get to a $1.28 Pop-tart. Squirrels, chipmunks, and rat-like-creatures abound.  Secure all your food in animal proof containers. \n\nCamping at Wheeler Peak Campground costs $12 a night (2016 prices).  Entry into Great Basin National Park is free (good deal \u2018eh?)\u2014you just have to drive there. Besides camping, the only other potential in-park cost is a visit to Lehman Caves, which is $8 for the hour tour and $10 for the 90-minute tour. \n\nEating at Wheeler Campground is a do-it-yourself proposition. There are no restaurants near the campground and the only place to eat actually in the park is at the Lehman Caves Cafe and Gift Shop, located at The Lehman Caves Visitor Center (closed in the winter).  Otherwise you have to go to Baker for any commercially served meals. \n", "Overview": "\n            \u00a0\nJeff Davis At Sunset\n\nGreat Basin National Park is in the middle of no-where on the Nevada/Utah border.  In its remote location, your choices for hotel stays are extremely limited and your options for camping are legion. If you are looking at climbing Wheeler Peak, Wheeler Peak Campground is directly adjacent to the trailhead and is a great place to get the west\u2019s most reasonable high-altitude camp experience \n\n\nOverview\n\nWheeler Peak campground, located at the very end of Wheeler Scenic Drive, is situated in a high alpine forest at 10,000 feet. It is first-come, first-served.  Talking to the rangers it sometimes fills-up on holiday and the occasional weekends in the summer.  Arriving during the week or early on Friday morning increases your chance of securing a spot to a near certainty.   \n\nThe 12-mile scenic drive to the campground is narrow, on an 8% grade and has sharp curves.  Single vehicles and trailers in excess of 24 feet in length are not permitted on the Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive beyond the Upper Lehman Creek Camp.  If you have a large rig, you might change your plans to either Upper or Lower Lehman Campgrounds. \n\nThere are numerous contingencies in the off chance Wheeler Campground is full; there are four other campgrounds in Great Basin and the area is surrounded by BLM land.  Ask the rangers at the visitor center and they can help steer you in the right direction. \n\n\u00a0\nNear the Campground\n\nThe campground has 37 sites available scattered around a paved loop.  Only one of the sites is wheelchair accessible.  The sites are roomy (2 vehicles or 3 tents) and most are reasonably secluded (a couple are in odd spots right near traffic).  Most of the sites are shaded or partial shade; be sure to consider where the sun will be in the evenings or mornings because the wrong spot gets awful cold.  Pay for your site within \u00bd hour of arrival and check out before 10 am.  \n\nWheeler Campsite closes during the winter and is open Jun through September.  Call the rangers and ask specific dates for a year.  Whether to bring winter gear is highly dependent on how late (or early) in the season you planning your trip; it may be 100 degrees in Utah but still snow-packed and freezing in June at Wheeler.  Talking to the rangers, the trail to Wheeler Peak may be snow covered past the 4th of July on a given year.  Even on years with early snowmelt, 10,000 ft of altitude skews the weather.

The Reintal is the main drainage from the Zugspitze, Germany's tallest mountain. The river Partnach, flowing through the Reintal is fed by the melting waters of glaciers and snowfields from the Zugspitz area. The Oberreintal has more the shape of a cirque, surrounded and formed by vertical rock faces, towers and needles, as well as knife sharp ridges leading down from the Wetterstein Crest. The Oberreintal drops into the Reintal over a steep and wooded terrace. A trail with never ending switch backs winds it's way from the river Partnach, gaining most of it's elevation in the steep high alpine fir forest, into the flat grounds of the Oberreintal cirque. The bottom of the cirque is covered with rock debris and scree and almost forms a round and level rock field of the size of a football stadium. The hut is located on the western edge of the field in a wonderful high alpine meadow. It is tucked under and in between big old Maple trees. The bench in front of the hut provides spectacular views to the legendary rock climbing walls rising across from the cirque.\r\n\r\nThe rock formations in the Wetterstein Range are Dolomite. Most of the climbing routes are solid rock, just a few routes and places are leading through some loose rock. The rock climber will find routes of all difficulties listed within the climbing grade tables. Many of the routes are equipped with drilled bolts, some are just clean free-climbing routes. High on the Wetterstein Crest, visible from the front porch of the hut, a bivouac shack provides shelter in an emergency situation. Most approaches to the climbing routes are short, and multiple climbing trips in one day are possible. If someone plans wisely it is even possible to return to the hut for lunch and go out for an other climb in the afternoon.", "Created/Edited": "Feb 22, 2006 / Feb 22, 2006", "Location": "Germany, Europe"},
{"Getting There": "To reach the Wild Basin Warming Hut, one must enter Rocky Mountain National Park through the Wild Basin Entrance Station (which is usually closed during the winter season)off of Hwy 7 and drive approximately two miles to the winter parking lot. From the parking lot, hike, ski or snowshoe the closed road or nearby horse trail for one mile past the Finch Lake TH to the Wild Basin Trailhead. The Warming Hut is located in the same building as the seasonal Wild Basin Ranger Station. \r\n\r\nBefore planning any trips into Wild Basin, be sure to compensate for the extra mile of traveling to reach the Wild Basin Trailhead from the winter parking lot. ", "Overview": "\n            The Wild Basin Warming Hut sits a few hundred feet North of the Wild Basin Trailhead, and is run through Volunteers of the National Park Service and Colorado Mountain Club. The purpose of the Warming Hut is to offer anyone in the area a place to enjoy the warmth of the fire away from the snow and wind. Anyone is welcome to step inside and visit, though only volunteers and their party is allowed to spend the night. The Warming Hut is located in the building that houses the Wild Basin Ranger Station, and a well worn trail leads from the bathrooms to the hut. \r\n\r\nThe Warming Hut makes a nice resting spot before or after a trip to several nearby destinations. Copeland Falls, Hidden Falls (ice climbing) Calypso Cascades, Ouzel Falls, serve as the most popular destinations during the winter, as beyond Ouzel Falls the trails are rarely used and may require trail-breaking. \r\n\r\nThe Warming Hut is usually open from 10am-4pm, November through April, but is not open every day, as volunteers must be present to use the hut. \r\n\r\nHut Coordinates: 13T 0451942mE 4451149mN", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/csumarmot/65368\">CSUMarmot</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=14&amp;distance_14=100&amp;distance_lat_14=40.20850&amp;distance_lon_14=-105.56635&amp;map_14=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.20850\u00b0N / 105.56635\u00b0W</a>", "Location": "Colorado, United States, North America", "Season": "Winter", "Object ID": "687865", "Created/Edited": "Dec 28, 2010 / Dec 28, 2010", "Object Title": "Wild Basin Warming Hut"},
{"Getting There": "\u00a0\r\nNearly there! - following the GR11 in the Est\u00f3s valley\r\nThere are three main ways to arrive at the Est\u00f3s refugio from the Benasque area, all of these requiring a long walk. The shortest way is via the GR11. Take the A-139 road in Benasque that runs north-east up the Ball de Benas until you reach the site of Camping Aneto (1314m.) on the left hand side of the road. \r\nInside the site entrance is the Puente Neuvo de San Chaime, an old stone bridge that crosses the Rio Esera and is the route of the waymarked path GR11. Follow the GR11 through the Estos valley and you will arrive at the refugio (1895m.) in about two and a half to three hours for the 11Km walk.\r\n\r\nThe second way is even longer as it starts from Eriste (1118m.) which is 3Km. south of Benasque. Go into the old pueblo and through the narrow streets towards the north and a waymarked path will be found leading up the Ball de Grist. This is the PR11 and it leads up through a thickly forested valley to the refugio of Angel Orus (2100m.) after 7Km. This is not quite halfway. From the refugio follow the GR 11.2 path to the north past the Cabana de Llardaneta, over the Collado de la Plana (2702m.) and descend into the Est\u00f3s valley past the Ibones de Batisielles. Here, the path runs above but parallel to the GR11, contouring round to cross the Rio de Est\u00f3s by a bridge and then dropping downhill and back down the valley for a short distance to the Estos refugio.\r\n\u00a0\r\nInside the refugio\r\n\r\nThe third way is the longest and is generally done as a tour of the refugios. Taking the same route as the second option, the trail then takes the GR11.2 in the oppostite direction from the Angel Orus refugio. The path climbs up to the north west via the Ball de Llardeneta to the Collado de Eriste (2860m.) Then go down into the Ball de Ribereta to the Biados refugio (1740m.) after 9Km. \r\n(This refugio is now privately operated - Johnnie September 2011)\r\nFrom the refugio the trail goes up the Ball D'Anes Cruces to the Puerto de Chistau (2577m.) and then drops down through the Barranco de Estos to the Est\u00f3s refugio, a further 10Km, making the whole trip around 26Km. In view of the the distance and height to be gained this is probably going to be too much for a day trip and an overnight stay at the Biados refugio would be sensible. \r\n\r\nIt is also possible to reach the Biados refugio from the south. The road head at San Juan de Plan is reached via the A 138 road either from Barbastro or via the Tunel de Bielsa from St Lary Soulan in France (D 929).\r\n                                                                                                                        ", "Overview of the Refugio": "\n            In the Huesca region of Aragon, in the Posets - Maladeta National Park, deep in the Ball d'Est\u00f3s many kilometres from the nearest road resides the Refugio de Est\u00f3s.\r\nThe hut is guardianed (Nando and Dani in 2008) throughout the year and has space for 115 people. All meals can be provided including packed lunches if required.\r\nLocated at an altitude of 1895 metres with outlooks up and down the valley it is a beautiful setting for many outdoor activities.

In the early 1980's the U.S. forest service built or reconstructed a network of shelters to serve the growing nordic skiing community that accessed the backcountry trails of the Willamette pass area. \r\n\r\nThe Gold lake snowpark is the center of the nordic network of shelters and trails. There is a volunteerski patrol that operates from a  cabin located at the snowpark. The shelters are all equipped with wood stoves,lofts and or platforms for sleeping. They are all stocked with a splitting maul,firewood,paper and matches. \r\n\r\nThe patrol cabin offers guest services such as parking and wilderness permits, weather condition information, a warming room with complimentary warm beverages. The cabin also is a first aid station and dispatch for the ski patrol.\r\n\r\nThe shelters are established at varying distances. Their are three within two and a half miles of the patrol cabin. \r\n\r\nWestview shelter a mere mile south of the cabin sits on a plateau at the base of westview butte. It is part of a network of trails called the westview loops. The trail system takes in the pacific crest trail from willamette pass to pengra pass an area of three by one and half miles square with outstanding views of glacially gouged Odell lake.\r\n\r\nThe Bechtel shelter is located two and a half of miles southwest of the patrol cabin. It is at the north boundary of the Diamond peak wilderness. It offers access to the pacific crest trail as it passes through the wilderness touching many lakes as it crosses over the shoulder of Diamond peak.\r\n\r\nThe Gold lake shelter is located a mile and a half north of the patrol cabin. It sits along the shore of Gold lake. It offers access to the Marylin lakes,Gold lake,Maiden peakand Fuji Mountain trail system.\r\n\r\nThese three shelters are the most popular with families, scouts, and the beggining to intermediate nordic skier. The shelters offer refuge in an outdoor setting with out the huge commitment of time and energy.\r\n\r\nThere are three other shelters that are located in more remote locations. These three shelters require advanced ski skills to negotiate the terrain and a half a day to a whole day to reach them.\r\n\r\nThe Fuji shelter is located five miles northwest of the patrol cabin. It sits on a forested plateau above the salt creek canyon at the south base of Fuji mountain. The area around the shelter offers great views of Diamond peak and Mt yoran. There are trails that weave through the lake studded plateau on there way to the summit of Fuji mountain,Mt ray, and on over to spectacular Waldo lake.. \r\n\r\nThe Maiden peak shelter is located six miles to the northwest of the patrol cabin. The shelter is located along the Pacific crest trail on the western base of Maiden peak. The route into this shelter ties in the rosary lakes and tait trails loop system. The Willamette pass ski area occupies most of the territory southwest of the shelter. The top of the lifts are great access to The maiden peak area. The maiden shelter is the only one in the network that is fully enclosed. It is an eight sided octagon with a front door and windows. It has so;ar panels to run interior lights and it sleeps up to fifteen people.\r\n\r\nThe South Waldo shelter is ten miles north of the patrol cabin. It is very remote and is only reccomended to those who have advanced backcountry skills. It is not uncommon to be brought part way in by snow mobile. Waldo lake is one of the largest lakes in oregon and is completly isolated in the winter and early spring months. It is one of the three purest lakes in the world standing in company with oregons own Crater lake and Russias lake baikal. The area is accessed by the waldo road and is shared with snowmobiles.\r\n\r\nAll six shelters are on a first come first serve basis. It is encouraged to share the facilities with all who come to visit. it is not uncommon to see tents sprout up around the shelters. The shelters are open to the public year around. The patrol cabin and shelters are stocked, manned and maintaned only during the winter months. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Created/Edited": "May 31, 2006 / Jun 2, 2006", "Object Title": "Willamette Pass nordic huts."},

Indoor and outdoor slippers are provided as well, so there is no excuse for being caught with you boots on while in the hut. I imagine the penalty for such an infraction is severe as the floors in the huts are in very good shape.  \r\n\r\nBringing your crampons, ice axe or backpack into the hut is also severely frowned upon, especially when there is a good anti-room with cubbyholes where you can store your gear, boots and other kit. \r\n\r\nThere are 6 spaces in the WCs that sits directly in front of the hut as well there is as a rather crude shower and wash area. Actually it is a hollowed out log with water running through it, which was most likely a sheep trough before it was pressed into service as a washbasin. The water is fresh melt right off the glacier so I do not think it gets much use except by us Canadian Polar Bear types who are into this kind of thing. \r\n\r\nEven though the water is melt coming off the glacier the locals claim it is unfit to drink so you are warned not to. \r\n\r\nThe hut serves three meals a day when it is staffed but breakfast and lunch usually only get made if there are people around beforehand so show up early for meal times. As for the food I never did try it but I imagine it would be simple but hardy as the kitchen was well equipped. \r\n\r\nThe one neat thing I really liked was the well stocked bar, quite the novelty for us NA types though I guess a prerequisite in Europe. The common rooms are nice with benches and tables and plenty of room and even a terrace of sorts on the sunny side of the Hut. \r\n\r\nIf you are expecting a good nights sleep before you climb in the morning you can forget it unless the hut is empty. Lights out is at 22:00 but from the reports I have read and people I have talked to there are the usual sounds of snoring and bumping about during the night that will wake all but the heaviest of sleepers. \r\n\r\nMost climbers, and the guides if they are there, will get up at about 02:00 for a 03:00 start so if you will have a hard time catching a few hours sleep. After 03:00 the place is very quite until the staff gets up at 07:00 so you will get a break.\r\n\r\nThe staff when I was there were great and they will try to be as helpful as they can. They do make hot tea in the morning for climbers and if you ask they will pack you a lunch as well.  As well they are normally quite knowledgeable about the present route conditions and I would heed their advice when given. \r\n\r\nI was there to try a solo attempt on Dufourspitze and they warned me of the bad crevasse conditions on the lower part of the climb. As I had no partner and there were no other parties on the peak I heeded their advice and did not attempt it in the dark. Later that day I went up just to check out the lower part of the climb and found the crevasse field a horrid mess of weak and broken snow bridges and a tangle of crisscrossing paths. I most likely would of come to grief had I tried to go though it in the dark by myself.\r\n \r\n\r\n", "Overview": "Situated like a castle on the top of a large ledge at the foot of the Monta Rosa the hut overlooks the Grenz Glacier coming down between Monta Rosa and Lyskamm, to the South one can see the Matterhorn and the Gorner Glacier and Gorner ridge, and directly across from the hut is the impressive north wall of Lyskamm. \r\n\r\nAs alpine huts go it is comfortable and spacious and one that is fun to visit even if one isn\u2019t climbing.\r\n\r\nOriginally built in 1885 as a small timber hut it has been continual upgrading and expanded, until today where it is an impressive stone hut with a staff of 3-4 and room for up to 150 guests.\r\n\r\nIt is owned and operated my the Monta Rosa Section of the Swiss Alpine Club (SAC) the Monte-Rosa-Hut is the best base camp for climbs on the Swiss side of the Monte-Rosa Massif. \r\n\r\n", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Created/Edited": "Jan 24, 2002 / Sep 16, 2012", "Peak Bagger Section": "\r\n\r\nThe Peaks that can be reached via normal routes originating from the hut are\r\nOn the Monta Rosa Massif itself there are the major peaks1.Dufourspitze4634 m2.Nordend46093.Zumsteinspitze45634.Signalkuppe4554As well as its minor peaks:5.Parrotspitze44366.Ludwigsh\u00f6he43417.Schwarzhorn (Corno Nero)43228.Balmenhorn41679.Vincent Piramide4215Finally there are well established normal routes starting at the hut to the follwing mountains1.Lyskamm45272.Castor42263.Pollux4092\r\nThe slopes of the Monta Rosa and the surrouding mountains are also very popular with alpine ski types so expect to find more of them about that actual climbers on some weekends.\r\n", "Location": "Wallis, Switzerland, Europe", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/jscoles/441\">JScoles</a>", "Dates Open & Reservations": "The hut is usually open and staffed from the second week in March till the first week of June.  \r\n\r\nIt opens again at the end of June till the last week in September.  \r\n\r\nAt all other times only the Ski hut is open with space for only 28 people and is usually unstaffed and on the honour system.\r\n\r\nReservations are not need but recommended during the peak summer and spring seasons.

After about 1 1/2 hours the trail reaches the end of the Gorner ridge and then turns sharply to the right to cross the glacier over to the hut. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe trail over the glacier is usually well marked with flags and crevasse and other glacial traps are small and few in number on this part of the glacier so ropeing up it not needed. The glacier is also heavily covered with a fine layer of grit so crampons are not usually necessary. Do watch out for the odd sink hole and there is occasional jump across the odd small crevasse just for fun. \r\n\r\nSummer 2012\r\nJust a note, the glacier path is very very crevassed and though safe when dry it could be problematic when covered witha layer of snow.\r\n\r\nExpect to take an extra hour to get through it now.  Back when I first worte this in 2001, it was a simple step across to the glacier. Now you have to decend at least 20m then cross a 3m bridge.  So you get an idea of how fast the it is going away. \r\n\r\nOne quickly crosses the Gorner glacier to a rather large lateral moraine, which marks the boundary between the Gorner and Grenz glacier, that comes down between Monta Rosa and Lyskamm.  The path may  meander more here on the Grenz  as there are more hazards on this glacier.\r\n\r\nOne continues on the Grenz for about another 45 mins until one is almost directly below the Hut, which is located high on a ridge above. The path then takes a rather steep and exposed series of switchbacks and steps up the ridge and then along the top of a moraine to a set metal stairs that lead to the hut.  There are steps, ropes and cables on this section of the hike but they were in a poor but not a dangerous state when I was there last in the summer of 2001.\r\n\r\nThe usual time for the trip is 2.5 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\nIn winter you can also get to it from the Stockhorn. To get to the Stockhorn one can either climb up from the valley below or take the Railway to Gornergrat then the Cable Car to Hohalligrat and then the Cable car to Stockhorn or traverse the ridge all the way from Gornergrat. No matter how you get to Stockhorn you basically head E along the ridge for about 30 min until you meet the Stockhorn Pass just below the Nordend and then traverse the Gornerglacier down though the rocks along the left side down and along the Monte-Rosa-Glacierbreak and the rocks. You reach the edge of the glacier at about 3120m. You then go slightly up on the S-side and traverse the middle tongue of the Monte-Rosa-glacier to the Unteren Plattje and then hut (2-3h) \r\n\r\nYou can also make the long ascent over the whole of the Gorner Glacier starting from Furi. The whole trip is about 9 km from with the gain of 940m in height and will take around 4 hours from Furi. Standard glacier traversing gear is recommended ie rope, crampons, ice-axe and a party of at least two, as conditions vary along the length of the glacier and there is no marked path. \r\n\r\nAnother option is to head directly down from Gorergrat along the goat trail. This is a very steep switchback trail (100+ of them) that starts about 300m past the summit observation platform at the Hotel on Gorergrat.\r\n \r\nThe Gornergrat train and the cable cars are rather expensive at 60sf for a round trip from Zermatt to Gorergrat and about the same if not more for the cable cars. The Gornergrat Train station is just across the street from the main train station in Zermatt.\r\n\r\nI myself like to walk in all the way from Zermatt it takes time but is a good acclimatization workout at 5-6 hours.\r\n\r\n", "New Hut": "\n            This page is now largly obsolete\r\n\r\nA new hut, a much larger silver steal and glass monstrocity, opened in 2009 just above the old one.\r\n\r\nThe old hut is now just a small foundation footprint, a small pile of rubble slowly making its way along the glacier and memories for many of us who staryed there.\r\n\r\n", "History": "\r\nHere is a quick chronology of the hut\r\n YearEvent1894-95The first log hut is built with space for 25 people.

The well known mountain guide from Pera di Fassa, Tita Piaz, bought this first shelter and built the Gartlh\u00fctte or Rifugio Re Alberto paying a tribute to the king of Belgium who used to climb in the Dolomites with him, the \u201cDevil of the Dolomites\u201d.\r\nThe hut was then extended a couple of times to form the present shape.\r\nThe \u201cDevil of the Dolomites\u201d\r\nTita Piaz was born in Pera di Fassa, 13th October 1879 in a little house situated right at the entrance of the Vajolet Valley.  Throughout his youth, Piaz saw all the major intrepid personalities of the dolomitic alpinism, make giant steps.  Between them it should be mentioned Georg Winkler whom, in 1887, climbed the \u201csmallest\u201d of the Vajolet Towers.\r\n\u00a0The Southern Vajolet Towers\r\nThe Fassa alpinism reached its higher levels with alpine guides such as Luigi Bernard, Luigi Rizzi and again with Tita Piaz.  He also climbed the Winkler Tower that until that moment was reserved to the most famous guides.  All his mountain climbing life was around this tower and another enterprise that he did when he was only twenty years old: he climbed alone the North-East crack of the Emma peak.  Preuss, about this, said that \u201cit was a unique enterprise in its genre related to the present times\u201d and together with Dulfer, they were so enthusiastic that they wanted to repeat it twice each!\r\nPiaz opened almost fifty new climbing ways.  At the beginning of his mountain climbing life, in 1899, he climbed 8 peaks in seven hours including two new ones; he started the east side of the Rosengarten and finished with the Delago tower; his tattered shoes were then exposed in a room of the Vajolet Hut, wishing, perhaps, to see a future alpine museum.\r\nThe course of events that really anticipated the modern concepts of alpinism happened when he climbed the Campanil Basso in the morning and the Winkler tower in the afternoon with a quick transfer by motorbike.\r\n\u00a0The Trinity of Dolomites\r\nBy Tita Piaz are also \u201cthe most difficult climbing of the Alps\u201d at the Campanil Toro in 1906, \u201cthe most celebrated climbing\u201d at the West tower of the Totenkirchl in 1908, \u201cthe most dangerous climbing\u201d on the North-West edge of the Schenon in 1926. From all these comes his nickname \u201cthe devil of the Dolomites\u201d!\r\nIn 1932, together with Virginio Dezulian, opened the \u201cVia Maria\u201d on the South pillar of the Sass Pordoi, a fourth degree climbing way still attended by lots of mountaineers from all over the world today.\r\nTita Piaz enterprises are an example of a modern and aware alpinism which stems from the owner of the mountains, in his own land, where he finds all his loves and passions.\r\nAfter a whole life spent climbing the most difficult and dangerous mountains, also with \u201cmoonlight\u201d ascents, Tita Piaz died in 1948 in a bike accident few meters away from his own house.\r\nThe King Laurin LegendOne of the most fascinating legends of the Dolomites explains why these mountains become colored in pink and orange during the sunset.\r\nAccording to this legend, on the Rosengarten, where today you can see until late spring a stain of snow in a sort of basin, you could find Laurin\u2019s garden of roses.\r\nThis is why the mountain is called Rosengarten in German, which means \u201cgarden of roses\u201d.\r\n\u00a0Silence in the Gartl Valley\r\nLaurin was the king of a population of dwarves who used to dig in the center of the mountain searching for crystals, gold and silver and he owned two magical weapons: a belt that could give him the strength of twelve men and a mantle that could turn him invisible.\r\nOne day the king of Adige decided to marry off his beautiful daughter Similde and for this reason invited the nobility of the neighborhood to a spring excursion.  King Laurin decided to participate anyway, but as an invisible guest.\r\nWhen he first saw Similde on the field of the knight\u2019s tournament, he immediately fell in love with her; he took her on the back of his horse and fled at full speed.  The knights immediately threw themselves into the chase to bring Similde back.  When King Laurin and Similde were driven into a corner by knights in front of the Garden of Roses he put on his magic belt and began to fight.\r\nWhen he realized that he was going to succumb anyway, he wore his mantle and started to jump everywhere in the garden, convinced that nobody could see him.  But the knights could see him by looking at his steps on the roses.  They got him; they cut his magic belt and imprisoned him.\r\nLaurin then, really angry, turned himself towards the Rosengarten, and convinced that it had betrayed him, uttered a curse: neither during the day nor the night, any human eye could admire it anymore.  But Laurin forgot to say the sunset and sunrise.  From that day it happens that either at the sunrise or the sunset the garden becomes bathed with beautiful colors."},

Later in the evening they camped up the mountain in the Gleckstein cave, then a rough bivouac site. Wills did not sleep well since he had to chase fleas in his blanket during the night. The next day they teamed up with the famous Gridelwald guide Christian Almer and his nephew whose intention it also was to make the first ascent of the Wetterhorn. They reached the summit together and celebrated the victory by putting up a fir tree. However, they mistakenly believed their ascent was the first since it was not well known that J. Haun and M. Banholzer had climbed the 3701 m high Wetterhorn already in 1844.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, sixteen years after Wills had slept in the cave, a real hut for 10 persons was erected at the location called Gleckstein (huge boulder).

From the hut there's a magnificent view over the Miage Face of Mt. Blanc, and on the opposite side over the Trelatete NE wall.  Diff. F, 1400m, 5-5.30h: \n\nFrom La Visaille/Plan Lognan, 1670 m. (in Val Veny, car park and a couple of small restaurants - reachable by car or using the bus service in 30 minutes from Courmayeur), walk 1 hour on the car road that goes up gently for almost 3 km. until the panoramic Plan Combal, 1990m  (tiny bar/restaurant here - a little deviations brings you in 5 minutes to the glacial Lac Miage). Until 1992 it was possible to drive up here, but massive rockfall from the adjacent Mt. Fortin has made local authorities put a barrier at Plan Lognan. There are plans to have the road reverted back to a forest trail.    \n From Plan Combal, follow the indications to \"Rif. Gonella\" (trail number \"S15\" marked in yellow). The trail pass briefly a gorgeous grassy area, the goes up steeply to reach the glacier moraine, first on a grassy/stony narrow ridge (awkward in rainy condition, pay attention here) then towards the centre covered with boulders and rocks (yellow painted sign points). In 2 or 3 hours, after passing the confluence of the Mont Blanc and Dome glacier to the right and the Trelatete couloir on the left, you reach the base of Aiguille Grises ridge (the Gonella Hut is very visible above you). Leave the glacier at 2650m (again, follow the indications) taking a small path through a zone of rock/grass terraces called locally \"Chaux De Pesse\" (the name means \"the pasture of the fir\") or \"Tsa Seche\" (\"the dry pasture\"). After a last section partially equipped with ladders\u00a0 in 1 additional hour, you're Gonella Hut. \nIf you want to avoid the 3 km of road at the beginning, there's a variation starting right from the car park near the picnic area (500m before Plan Lognan): take the trail marked \"Casolari Freney\". After crossing the Dora river on two bridges, on the left, take the path marked \"Lago Delle Marmotte\" (trail number S18). The path (with many ups and downs) cross all the tree covered lower part of the moraine, into a small plain where used to be the nice \"Marmot Lake\", unfortunately destroyed by a huge flood in 2000. From here, there's an evident path going up the moraine again, where it meets the previous itinerary.

Without basic alpine gear (rope, crampons,...) this hut cannot be reached (safely). \r\n\r\nThis rather isolated location makes it a relatively quiet hut, where most of the time only mountaineers are staying. Unlike it's closeby neighbour, the Becherhaus, almost no hikers will be seen here. \r\n\r\nAlthough the hut is located in Italy, German is the main language (due to the fact it's located in the Autonomous Italian regio of South Tyrol).\r\n\r\nIce climbing just outside the M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte", "Page Type": "Hut/Campground", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/koenvl/43028\">KoenVl</a>", "Created/Edited": "Aug 3, 2012 / Aug 3, 2012", "How to get there": "There are four accesroutes to the M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte, each with several alternative routes.

Dresdnerh\u00fctte-Wilder Pfaff- M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte: From the Dresdnerh\u00fctte (2302m) one can either hike/climb  or take the lift towards the Schaufeljoch (3155m)(The Dresdnerh\u00fctte is located in the middle of the Stubaigletscher ski-area, also open in summur). From the Schaufeljoch one goes towards the Pfaffenjoch (3212m), after which you pass the Z\u00fcckerh\u00fctl (3505m)(when there's enough time you can grab the Z\u00fcckerh\u00fctl on the way). Then you go to the Pfaffensattl (3332m), ascent and afterwards descent the Wilder Pfaff (3458m)(Pfaffengrat, II grade rockclimbing). The M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte lies at the end of the Pfaffengrat.\r\nCa. 6h from the Dresdnerh\u00fctte.\r\n\r\nB. Dresdnerh\u00fctte-Beiljoch-M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte. From the Dresnderh\u00fctte a hiking trail leads towards the Beiljoch (2676m). Descent the Beiljoch on to the Sulzenauferner (glacier), crossing the low end of the glacier/morene, after which this route joins the route from the Sulzenauh\u00fctte.\r\n\r\nC. Sulzenauh\u00fctte (2191m)-M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte: from the Sulzenauh\u00fctte one has to follow a marked hiking path (L\u00fcbeckerweg) untill reaching the Fernerstube (glacier). Around 2750m-2800m one can step onto the glacier, keeping to the left on the glacier. Straight up till about 3000m, after which one follows the glacier bending to the left.after this bend once again straight forwards, till one reaches the ridge (3144m) leading to the col just beneath the Wilder Freiger (3418m). Follow this rigde till you reach the col beneath the Wilder Freiger (when the weather is good it's not a huge detour to climb the Wilder Freiger).

From the Teplizerh\u00fctte a marked trail leads to the Becherhaus (3195m). However, it's not necessary to climb to the Becherhaus itself. One can walk underneath the Becherhaus, comming onto the glacier (\u00dcbeltalferner) at around 3000m. From there one can walk in a more or less straight line to the M\u00fcllerh\u00fctte. \r\nCa. 4-5h from the Teplizerh\u00fctte.\r\n\r\n3.

Either scramble up the rock rib to the north of the Grand Couloir or sprint across the couloir and scramble up the easier slope to the hut (fixed ropes there). \r\n\r\nOr you drive to Les Houches (by bus or car). At Les Houches, a cable car goes to the Hotel Bellevue. Then you walks ca. 300 m to the station of the Tramway du Mont Blanc.

First informations about the hut came from the year 1670. It was a small shelter of a man who was guarding trouts in the lake (on behalf of Schlaffgotsch family, the owner of the area in that time).\r\nIn the middle of XIX century Karkonosze became a mass tourist attraction (because of providing Jelenia Gora the acces to railways) so owners of the shelters had to rebuild and enlarge them. In that time the hut belonged to Karol Haring, but he was forced to sell the hut to Henryk Richter in 1891. The object was being modernizied through these years: just before the begining of XX century the symbol of Samotnia- a small tower with a bell (the date on the bell is 1861)- was built. Next owners are: Franciszek Krauze, Hasse family (before the Second World War) and Stanislaw Staron, Zbigniew Pawlowski, Cezary Marcinkowski (after the war).\r\nDefinitely the most known and the most important owner of the hut in it\u2019s history was Waldemar Siemaszko (the hut is now named after him) who started managing the hut on June 13. 1966. He died in a car accident on the road from the hut to Vang in 1994. From that time the owner of the hut is Sylwia Siemaszko.\r\n"},

Although the first notable ascent took place in 1465, \u015anie\u017cka started being popular among tourists in 1681, when the Chappel of the Saint Lawrence on the top was biult. The biult took 15 years, and was sponsored by Count Leopold von Schaffgotsch. Since 1708 regular masses had been celebrated in the chappel so the peak was ascended by tons of pilgrims and wanderers. Hundread years later the masses stopped being celebrated and the building was empty for over 10 years. Here starts the origins of the hut on the top of \u015anie\u017cka: Karol Siebenhaar was giving meals to the tourist and they may use the biulding as a shelter. The idea made \u2018strike home\u2019, so in 1850 a big hostel was erected next to the chappel, but unfortunately it burnt down 7 years later. In 1862 another hostel was built and it prospered to 1967.\r\n\r\nAfter Second World War became a border mountain between Poland and Czechoslovakia. In 1949 Czechoslovakians biult a chair lift to the top which is now the oldest construction of that type- it increased the amount of tourists visiting the top so the Poles started to create plans of rebuilding the Polish hut. The execution of these plans took place over twenty years after the war. The built started in 1969 and finished in 1974. The project of three conected plates was created by W. Lipi\u00f1ski and W. Wawrzyniak. At the same time the old hut was demolished and the road to the top was rebiult.\r\n\r\nThe new building consits of three parts (plates);\r\nthe lowest and the biggest: restauration, buffet and administrative rooms.\r\nthe medium: rooms and observatory.\r\nthe highest and the smallest: meteorological observatory named after Tadeusz Ho\u0142dys.\r\n\r\nThe hut doesn\u2019t belong to PTTK (Polskie Towarzystwo Tuystyczno-Krajoznawcze).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meteorological observatory\r\n\r\n\u015anie\u017cka is widely known for meteorological observations made from the top. The first observatory was created in the hostel in 1880, 20 years later a separated observatory was built on the top, and another 5 years later firs road to the top. \r\nThe whole history about the meteorological observatory on the top of \u015anie\u017cka you can find here.", "Object Title": "The hut on \u015anie\u017cka", "Created/Edited": "Sep 7, 2007 / Oct 1, 2007", "History": "\u00a0"},
