CROSSING TO CHILE\r\n\r\nThis itinerary is a great way to reach Chile and its \"carretera austral\" to  Villa O'Higgins.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nDay 1 :\r\n- First there is a bus to take from El Chalten to Lago del Desierto (10USD / 90 minutes of shaky road)\r\n- At Lago del Desierto you can either take a boat across or walk (5hrs).\r\n- Once on the other side of the lake you have to walk on another hour to reach the Argentinian/Chilean border\r\n- Camp there\r\n\r\nDay 2 :\r\n- Walk for another 5hrs to reach Lago O'Higgins\r\n- Then take a boat from a boat from Puerto Candelario to Puerto Baham\u00f3ndez (3hrs)\r\n- Eventually take a shuttle between Puerto Bahamondez to Villa O'Higgins (30min)\r\n\r\nAll timing details on Villa O'Higgins website.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Getting There": "\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe easiest way to access El Chalten is by bus from El Calafate (4hrs). Among others, two companies are doing the trip every day : CalTur and Chalten Travel (30USD return).\r\nThe road is a bit shaky on some parts, but the trip is quite enjoyable.\r\n\r\nActually if the roads gets perfect, we might see hundreds of day-hikers come, which would be great for local shop but sad for people who enjoy quiet nature.\r\nThey plan on asphalting it all, at some point.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to go to El Chalten from Bariloche, as Chalten Travel organise buses between El Calafate and Bariloche.\r\nBut it is costly (around 150 USD) and not frequent. The best is to get advice in Bariloche.\r\n\r\nTo access El Calafate :\r\n> by bus from Rio Gallegos (Argentina) ; or Puerto Natales and Punta Arenas (Chile)\r\n> by plane from Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Ushuaia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Object Title": "El Chalten", "Overview": "\n            El Chalten is a charming little town expanding madly.\r\nMore and more trekkers come around to enjoy beautiful landscapes, granit peaks and pure lakes.\r\nIt is also the perfect base town to go climbing the magnificent Cerro Torre and Cerro Fitz Roy.\r\n\r\nEl Chalten has a taste of lost Far-West when you first arrive, but has a real mountain (trek/climb) atmosphere when you stay for a few days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/andino/31039\">Andino</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=-49.31617&amp;distance_lon_10=-72.88879&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">49.31617\u00b0S / 72.88879\u00b0W</a>", "Classic Trekking in PN Los Glaciares": "\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe north part of PN Los Glaciares you can access from El Chalten is a real treasure for trekkers. You can go for a day hike to see Cerro Torre, Fitz Rio or the Rio Electrico valley. Or you can organise a nice little tour. A suggestion would :\r\n\r\nDay 1 :\r\n- Morning bus from El Calafate\r\n- Quick lunch in El Chalten\r\n- 3 hour walk up to Campamento Bridwell (also called \"De Agostini\") to enjoy the great view on Laguna Torre and Cerro Torre\r\n- Camp there\r\n\r\nDay 2 :\r\n- Walk from Campamento Bridwell to Campamento Poincenot, via Laguna Hija & Madre (4 hours)\r\n- Leave your stuff at the Campamento Poincenot and walk up to Lago de Los Tres to observe Cerro Fitz Roy (45 to 60 minutes)\r\n- Back to Campamento Poincenot to camp (in low season if Campamento Rio Blanco is empty you can try to sleep there, but bear in mind it is supposedly dedicated to climbers rather than trekkers).\r\n\r\nDay 3 :\r\n- You can go back to Lago de Los Tres to enjoy Fitz Roy on the morning sunrise.\r\n- From there 3 choices :\r\n1. Walk back directly to El Chalten via Laguna Capri\r\n2. Go for a 2h walk to Laguna/Glaciar Piedras Blancas (definitely worth it), and then back to El Chalten.\r\n3. Go further north for an extra day of hiking along Rio Electrico (camp up there and on the forth day return to El Chalten).\r\nWe chose option 2 as the weather was not excellent on the 3rd day and as we wanted to go Lago del Desierto (see below). Keep also in mind than weather is changing VERY fast. So if the weather is good always try to go see Cerro Torre and Fitz Roy, as it could then be rainy and cloudy for 3-4 days in a row. I heard that Cerro Torre has more chances to be hidden by clouds than Fitz Roy. If the weather is nice, it would therefore be a better bet to start with Laguna Torre as we did.\r\n\r\n", "Location": "Argentina, South America", "Sleeping and Eating": "In the PN Los Glaciares you can camp as long as you remain in the camping area.\r\nOutside these sites, it is strictly forbidden.

{"Activities": "Hiking, Bouldering, Scrambling, Skiing", "Getting There": "From Fresno head east on Highway 180.  Unless you get behind a slow motorhome, it should only take a little over an hour to get to Grant Grove.  This road is open year-round but it does get snow in the wintertime and chains may be required.  \r\n\r\nYou can also get to Grant Grove from the south via Highway 198 and the General's Highway.  From Visalia head east on Highway 198 and in about one hour you will reach the park entrance.  Here this road becomes the General's Highway.  Follow it up to Lodgepole, about one hour from the park entrance.  From Lodgepole head west and in about one hour you will get to Grant Grove.  This road is closed periodically in the wintertime following snow storms and chains may be required at any time.  \r\n\r\nOther less-travelled ways...  Highway 245 that goes north from Highway 198 near Woodlake up to Highway 180 near Pinehurst is a very winding slow-going road.  It is one I have only traveled once and have vowed to never go that way again!  The Dry Creek Road is a better option.  From Visalia head east on Highway 198 to Lemon Cove.  In Lemon Cove turn left on Highway 216 which goes west towards Woodlake.  Go just a short distance and just after you cross the bridge across the Kaweah River turn right on the Dry Creek Road.  This road will eventually tie in with Highway 245 but is not nearly as winding.  It is especially pretty to drive in the spring (April/May) when the wildflowers are blooming or fall (October/November) when the leaves are changing color.  Both Highway 245 and Dry Creek may have chain requirements in the winter months.\r\n\r\nOne other option: Highway 63 north from Visalia will take you up to Highway 180 near Squaw Valley and from here you can head east on Highway 180 to Grant Grove.  \r\n\r\nPlease note that if you're driving an RV longer than 22 feet Highway 180 or Highway 63 are your only good options as all of the other roads are very steep and winding.  \r\n\r\nGrant Grove Map\r\n\r\nLink to more area maps", "Object Title": "Grant Grove", "Trails to Hike and Things to See": "The General Grant Tree Trail \r\nLength is approximately 1/2 mile and it is an easy, paved trail, great for the whole family.\r\n\r\nAlong the way you'll see the Robert E. Lee Tree, the Fallen Monarch, the Gamlin Cabin, the Centennial Tree, the California Tree, and of course the General Grant Tree.  \r\n\r\nThe Robert E. Lee Tree grows next to the Fallen Monarch and is the 11th largest tree in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Gamlin brothers used the Fallen Monarch, a fire-hollowed sequoia log, as a summer residence while they were building their cabin, and also used it to house a hotel and saloon. John Trout and John Carrington, the loggers who felled the Centennial Tree, also lived here, and the Cavalry used it as a temporary stable for their 32 horses. \r\n\r\nThomas and Israel Gamlin built their cabin from sugar pine logs in 1872. The Gamlins were the first white residents of the Grant Grove. They grazed cattle here during the summers before the sequoia grove was designated as a National Park. While General Grant National Park was created in 1890, the National Park Service did not come into existence until 1916. The first rangers in this park were members of the US Cavalry, who used this building for hay and grain storage. It was also the home of Ranger Davis, the park's first civilian ranger, from 1902 to 1909. \r\n\r\nThe Centennial Tree was chopped down in 1875 to be displayed at the America's Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. A sixteen-foot portion of the tree was sliced off, split into sections and hauled out of the forest by bull team. Unfortunately, because of the tree's great size and the obvious lines where the pieces had been reassembled, the tree was laughed out of the exposition as the \"California Hoax.\" \r\n\r\nIn August 1967, the California Tree was struck by lightning. The top 25' of the tree shattered and caught on fire. Although lightning-caused fires are a natural part of the sequoia forest, the California Tree is right next to a trail which hundreds of visitors walk every day. The Park Service decided that the smoke, burning embers and possible falling branches were a safety hazard, and that the fire needed to be put out. Park forester Charlie Castro climbed a fir tree adjacent to the giant sequoia, then traversed a rope stretched between the two trees and ascended to a place where he could extinguish the fire with a hose!\r\n\r\nThe General Grant Tree was discovered in 1862 by Joseph Hardin Thomas and named in 1867 by Lucretia Baker. Five years later, on March 1, 1872, Ulysses Grant, now president of the United States, signed the bill designating Yellowstone as the world's first national park. The area around the Grant Grove of giant sequoias was set aside in 1890 as General Grant National Park. (Yosemite National Park was created in the same piece of legislation.) In 1940, General Grant was included in the newly created Kings Canyon National Park.  \r\n\r\nPresident Calvin Coolidge proclaimed this \"The Nation's Christmas Tree\", and ceremonies are still held at the base of the tree on the second Sunday in December. In 1956, President Eisenhower designated the Grant Tree as a living National Shrine in memory of Americans who have died in war. \r\n\r\nNorth Grove Loop Trail\r\nLength is approximately 1.5 miles.  From the General Grant Tree Trail Parking area hike east to the lesser-traveled North Grove Loop Trail.  This trail leads past some beautiful sequoias and meadows.  \r\n\r\nSequoia Lake Overlook/Dead Giant Loop\r\nLength is approximately 2.2 miles.  Starts near the Grant Tree parking area.  The Dead Giant is an unusually large sequoia which shows signs of man-caused death. If you look closely, you will find axe marks girdling the tree, severing the cambium layer. With this living layer cut, nutrients could no longer move up the tree and the giant died. Also along this trail, you can enjoy a picturesque view of a historic mill pond and reflect on the differences between management of National Forest and National Park land. \r\n\r\nBig Stump Basin Trail\r\nLength is approximately one mile, it is a loop trail suitable for most hikers.  The area reveals the remains of early logging. The Mark Twain Stump is all that's left of the 26-foot-wide, 1,700-year-old tree that took two men 13 days to cut down in 1891. Also, because sequoia wood decays slowly, piles of sawdust created more than a century ago still remain.  Trail starts at the Big Stump Picnic Area on Highway 180 3 miles southwest of Grant Grove.\r\n\r\nPanoramic Point\r\nAt Grant Grove Village, take the narrow, steep, 2.3-mile road that snakes east to Panoramic Point. From the parking area, take the one-quarter-mile trail to the 7,520-foot-high ridge. The view takes in a magnificent stretch of the High Sierra. You can see Hume Lake in Sequoia National Forest and, just beyond a low ridge behind the lake, Kings Canyon. No RVs or trailers are permitted. \r\n\r\nBoole Tree Trail\r\nFrom Grant Grove travel northeast about 5 miles to the turnoff to Converse Basin.  From here it is about a 2.5 mile drive along a narrow dirt road to the Boole Tree Trailhead.  It is a 2.5 mile round trip hike to the Boole Tree, the 6th largest tree in the world.  Converse Basin was almost completely logged in the 1890's by the Sanger and later the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company.  In 1935 the land was taken over by Sequoia National Forest and now you'll find many vigorous young sequoia trees growing amongst the giant stumps that remain from the logging operation.  Ask for a map at the visitor center.  Click here for my webpage describing a hike to the Boole Tree.  Click here for more info on the lumbering operations.  I also recommend the book The Felled the Redwoods by Hank Johnston.  \r\n\r\nRedwood Canyon\r\nRedwood Canyon is one of the largest of all sequoia groves, and contains the Hart Tree, the 24th largest sequoia. Sixteen miles of trail are available for short walks, day hikes and overnight backpacking trips (wilderness permits are required and are available at the Grant Grove Visitor Center). As you hike through sequoia/mixed conifer forest, meadow and shrubland, you will see sign of many fires, some recent, some ancient. The National Park Service and cooperating universities learned through observation and experiment at Redwood Canyon that fire is a critical factor in the health and vigor of sequoia forests. Beginning in 1969, prescribed fires have burned portions of this forest to allow giant sequoias to reproduce, to reduce fuel and to restore the forest to the condition it was 100 years ago. The trailhead for this area is 2 miles down a rough dirt road 5 miles south of Grant Grove. This road is closed to vehicle traffic in the winter.  Click here for my webpage describing an overnight backpack trip in Redwood Canyon.  Click here for the Summitpost page on Redwood Canyon.  \r\n\r\nBuena Vista Peak\r\nThe 2 mile round-trip hike up this granite peak begins just south of the Kings Canyon Overlook on the Generals Highway, 6 miles southeast of Grant Grove. From the top of Buena Vista Peak, a 360-degree view looks out over the majestic sequoias in Redwood Canyon, Buck Rock Fire Tower, and beyond to a splendid panorama of the high Sierra.\r\n\r\nBuck Rock\r\nThis spectacular granite outcropping east of Grant Grove has a fire lookout tower perched atop it.  It was built in 1923 and is on the National Register of Historic Lookouts.  It is still being manned in the summer months and the short hike and climb up the steep staircase is one I highly recommend!  The view from the top is fantastic and the lookout personnel are very knowledgable and nice.  Rock climbers often frequent the rock as well.  Click here for the Summitpost page on Buck Rock.\r\n\r\nHume Lake\r\nThere is a 3 mile trail that circles Hume Lake.  Hume Lake was built as a mill pond, and to supply water for a flume that floated rough-cut sequoia lumber from Converse Basin to the planing mill at Sanger, 54 miles away. The lake is in Sequoia National Forest. During the summer, it also offers fishing, swimming, boat rental (available through Hume Lake Christian Camps) and a Forest Service campground, as well as gas, groceries and a small laundry. Hume Lake is about 15 miles from Grant Grove.  You can go northeast on Highway 180 to the Hume Lake turnoff then go south to the lake.  Or you can go southeast on the General's Highway to the Hume Lake turnoff then go north to the lake.  \r\n                                                              ", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/tarol/26978\">tarol</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=32.84000&amp;distance_lon_10=-113.91000&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">32.84000\u00b0N / 113.91\u00b0W</a>", "Weather & Webcams": "Summer in the middle elevations of Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks (4000-7000 feet) is characterized by warm days and cool evenings.

Grant Grove is the first one you come to as you enter the park on Hwy 180.  It is on a gently sloping plateau at approximately 6,500 feet in elevation and is situated amongst Sierra mixed conifer forest.  There are several sequoia groves nearby as well as beautiful mountain meadows, streams, waterfalls, and vista points.  \r\n\r\nIn Grant Grove there is a visitor center, market, restaurant, lodge, cabins, post office, campgrounds, etc....  almost everything hikers and climbers need when in the park, all within walking distance of each other.  The only thing really missing is a gas station, but there are two nearby, one at Hume Lake and one at Kings Canyon Lodge, each about 15 miles away.  You can also buy emergency gasoline at the Grant Grove Market, but expect to pay a pretty penny!  So it is highly recommended you fuel up your vehicle before you come.  \r\n\r\nA bit of history...  In 1890 shortly after Sequoia National Park was created (as the nation's second national park), General Grant National Park followed.  It was just a small national park that is in the same place Grant Grove is today.  It contained the Grant Sequoia Grove, home of the General Grant Tree which is the 2nd largest tree in the world.

Not until 1978, with the completion of the 170 kilometers long Gilgit-Skardu Road, did Baltistan have any permanent access to the rest of the world, even in 1980s the citizens retained their self-sufficiency and independence, aloof from the twentieth century and its wonders. So formidable in the scale of its colour and texture, savagery and desolation is the Indus gorge out of Skardu that not even Balti\u2019s ventured to cross it. The road to Skardu is one of the most dramatic roads in the world, following the narrow, dark, bleak, and stupendously high ravine of the Indus for mile after mile. Never a blade of gross relieves the monotony of the hostile rock. Only the jade green river, tumbling and foaming in stretches of white water, relieves the grey, brown, sere, and unrelenting walls of boulders- strewn rock, and cliffs. Like its larger sister, the Karakoram Highway, it represents one of the world\u2019s major feats of civil engineering construction and already Skardu, long a Mecca for the high altitude mountaineers, have become a major tourist resort as the coaches, cars, and jeeps flood down the road across more than 20 bridges to the town. \r\n\r\nOne can reach Skardu from Islamabad by air too. The Pakistan International Airlines operate a daily flight for Skardu, subject to clear weather conditions. Within fifteen minutes of taking off from the Islamabad Airport, in PIA scheduled flight, we will be in a virgin world snaking through mountain passes and following emerald ribbons of rivers, the plane will be often lower than the level of the treacherous road. Every turn will brought a breathtaking new vista, and as we will leave habitation behind, we will enter a forest of peaks and nature of such staggering perfection that it flooded one simultaneously with a soaring joy and a stark realization of the absolute insignificance of man. Leaving the plain, the most immediate impression is that of disorientation. The valley and the rock and the desert plains have no likeness to any other landscape, as if the Sahara had been dropped down between massive walls of rock. There are no perspectives. So complete is the circle of mountains everything narrow and the eye is ever confused. Lying within this ring of 5000 meters high mountains that glimmer through the haze in varying shades of purple, grey, and ochre, the jade river Indus snakes sinuously between the ribboned, wind-blown sand dunes close beneath a 200 feet high island of massive rock. It\u2019s here that Skardu straggles along the plateau.\r\n\r\n", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/afzal/36391\">Afzal</a>", "Created/Edited": "Apr 3, 2011 / Apr 3, 2011", "Location": "Pakistan, Asia", "Overview": "\n            The Skardu is the capital city of Baltistan. Its real attraction is as gateway to the grandest sight in all nature, Concordia, the amphitheater of the ten of the world\u2019s thirty greatest mountains, the adjacent glaciers and peak, and its closeness to Lake Satpara, one of the hidden pearls of Baltistan.\r\n\r\nSkardu city\r\n\r\nAt 2314 meters and due to confluence of the Indus and Shigar rivers, this is the capital town of the Baltistan. It has a pleasant climate has been the capital for a long time. In summer dusty winds frequently arise during the afternoon and continue till evening. Scattered among the apricots trees, poplars, willows and bushes are the residences, Government Offices, Banks, hospital, mosques, places, shops, markets and hotels. The shops and markets sales the food items, camping equipments, fur toques, Karakul fez, turbans and flowing togas of rough wool worn by the local inhabitants. Mountaineering and Trekking parties arrive here, stay for a short period and leave as quickly as possible for the mountains. The airport is situated 16 kilometer south-west of the Skardu. The most important monuments in the region is the rock carving of Buddha, some one and half kilometer south on the road to Satpara. It dates back to the 10th century AD. The entire surface of the rock, 8 meter high and some 5 meter wide, is carved with great imagination and skill. At 15th century aqueduct located in the town is an interesting feature to see. The fort of Kharpochu, which stands high up on the rock of Skardu, overlooks the streets of the town. Hotels for tourist are available, as there are many hotels.

{"When To Climb": "The best time of the year to climb at Courtright is from late spring to late fall. Generally, PG&E maintains the access gate to Courtright (locate at the beginning part of the Courtright Rd). This gate usually opens on Memorial Day weekend or on a day that PG&E can access Courtright if the snow year was heavy. Closure depends on when the first good snow comes. The usual rule of thumb is follow the same closures observed as that of Tioga Road (Hwy 120). It will be PG&E's call when they will close the gate for the season. Check for gate conditions with the Sierra National Forest HQ in Prather (559) 855-5360 (press \"0\" for immediate transfer to a ranger). For all practical purposes, DO NOT call PG&E directly! The management with PG&E, at Wishon Reservoir, work hand in hand with the forest service and keep the national forest informed of all company activities, road closures and/or miscellanous information needed for recreationalists and visitors.\r\n\r\nDaytime temps range from the low 60's to the low 80's, depending on the time of the year. Nightime temps usually range from the high 30's to the upper 50's.   \r\n", "Getting There": "Most people from the Bay area or Los Angeles will drive to Fresno via Hwy 99 South or North, respectively. Once in the Fresno city limits, take Hwy 180 East toward Kings Canyon. Stay on the 180 until the exit appears for Hwy 168 East. Exit onto Hwy 168 and travel its length to the town of Shaver Lake (30 miles), passing the small town of Prather along the way. After Prather, Hwy 168 will become a 4-lane road heading up a moderately steep grade. The highway will return to a 2-lane road at the top of the grade before reaching the mountain town of Shaver Lake (another 4 miles, once the highway returns to 2-lanes again). Just inside the town limits of Shaver Lake, turn right onto Dinkey Creek Rd. Follow this for approximately 11 miles to almost the roads end. Prior to the road ending (approx. 1/4 mile) is McKinley Grove Rd. Turn right onto McKinley Grove Rd and over the bridge that crosses Dinkey Creek. Follow McKinley Grove Rd. for approximately 13 miles till one reaches a signed intersection for Courtright and Wishon Reservoirs (this sign appears after travelling on the only mile long straight section of McKinley Grove Rd!). Turn left for 'Courtright Reservoir' and follow this single lane access road for approximately 8 miles to the reservoir. You'll know you're there when you get your first amazing eyeful of Power Dome on the right side, prior to arriving at the shore side of the reservoir. Total approximate distance travelled from Fresno is 100 miles and takes roughly 2 and half hours to complete.....but 'oh-so' worth it!\r\n", "Overview": "\n            *CURRENT INFORMATION*: It is official....Courtright Reservoir is now OPEN as of June 28th 2010.\r\n\r\n\r\nHidden well within the boundries of the Sierra National Forest is Courtright Reservoir, the \"lost sister\" to the ever captivating Tuolumne Meadows. Located 2 hours east of Fresno, Courtright boasts of the same qualities as that of the terrain found in the high country of Tuolumne. Pristine, high quality granite domes torture the climbers imagination and entices any adventurer to scout the infinate possibilities. The signature landmark upon entering the Courtright area is the 500 foot high Power Dome. Teeming with a host of 5-pitch, friction scare-a-thons, Power Dome will make a marked impression in the minds and hearts of inspiring rock jocks. Scattered around the perimeter of the reservoir are a myriad of other domes and walls. Trapper, Spring, Maxon, Penstemon and Dusy are just a few domes that provide countless adventures, where traditional and sport  climbs abound. Although the domes provide ample friction, smear and fine edge climbing routes, Courtright also offers several crack climbs at areas like Tiger Wall and Tiger Cage (featuring the hailed twin splitter, \"This Pussy Eats You\"). The Sequoia/Kings Canyon guidebook by Sally Moser, Greg Vernon and David Hickey, has dedicated over a third of the books contents to Coutright Reservoir alone!! Best of all, you won't find yourself pulling from the ticker- tape to wait your place in line for a route. The majority of the visitors that frequent Courtright are fishermen.  And, of course, the final beauty of the place is that the camping is FREE and so are the spectacular views into the Goddard Divide. \r\n", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Red Tape/Camping": "Although a fire permit is required for any campfire constructed in the national forest, the remaining amenities are FREE! All fire permits can be acquired at the Sierra National Forest HQ building, located in Prather along the 168.\r\n\r\nThere are also paid campsites available in Courtright, sponsored and maintained by PG&E. The camping fee per site is $15.00 per night. The campsite are provided with picnic tables, fire pits, water and pit toilets. There are two sites: Voyager Rock campground (14 campsites, tents only) is located on the southeast shoreline of the reservoir while Trapper Spings campground is located near the eastern shoerline, 2.2 miles to the north (following the single lane road along the east side of the reservoir). This campground has a total of 75 tents sites and 45 trailer sites. This campground is within stone's throw distance to both Spring Dome (aka Marmot Dome) and Trapper Dome.\r\n\r\nFor reservations to both campgrounds, call 877-444-6777 or TDD 877-833-6777.\r\n\r\nAs for other camping, respect the areas that are signed as \"No Camping\" areas. But for the most part, camping is FREE. Let's do our part as a climbing community and keep it that way! Respect all national forest rangers and PG&E employees. \r\n", "\"The Playground\"": "This section is a summary of the domes and walls featured at Courtright. Of course, an adventursome spirit is warranted to explore the overall area but the use of the 'Southern Sierra Rock Climbing: Sequoia/Kings Canyon' guidebook is extremely helpful. This guidebook provides ample information on the \"how's, where's, what's and when's\" to Courtright climbing.\r\n\r\nThe listing of domes and features are in order of the most southern feature to the most northern feature (based on moving counterclockwise around the reservoir):\r\n\r\nDome Of The Immaculate Conception (aka Notre Dome)\r\n  + The dome features sustained micro edging and several clean cracks (mostly 5.10's).\r\n\r\n-Lost Canyon Wall\r\n  + Located to the east by following the Short Hair Creek, this wall features some moderate yet wildly exposed climbs. It also has its share of steep and overhanging routes (5.7 to 5.11).\r\n\r\n-Tiger Cage\r\n  + Hidden to the east, just a few hundred yards off of Courtright Rd  and slightly south of the reservoir, Tiger Cage has a variety of climbs: thin friction slab, steep face and cracks. Be sure to check two of its classics: 'This Pussy Eats You' (.10b), a nice lead climb for potential crack feinds, and 'Little Black Sambo' (a 5.9, not identified in the SeKi guide). The later climb is located on the left most part of the wall and features delicate friction. A good lead warm up for the ever classic multi-pitch 'A Little Nukey' (5.9-) on Power Dome. There are several anchors that can be accessed on top for top roping most routes.\r\n\r\n-Tiger Wall\r\n  + Located next to Tiger Cage, this 75 foot orange and black overhanging wall covers stout face and crack climbs ranging from mid 10's to burly 12's. Recommended routes: 'Hungry Tiger' (.10b) and 'Tiger By The Tail' (.11c)\r\n\r\n-Broken Tiers/Transformer Wall\r\n  +Located down in the Helms Canyon, next to the reservoir spillway, this wall seldoms sees traffic due to loose rock. However, there are some selected routes that won't disappoint crack climbers: 'American Pie' (a 3 pitch, 5.9) and 'Knappy Sack' (a mellow 50 foot.10a)\r\n\r\n-Power Dome\r\n  +Located in the Helms Canyon, one can spot this dome to the right from Courtright Rd. (upon entering the area). This dome is the hallmark of Courtright and rightly so. Power Dome hosts some bold friction climbs with the occasional solution pocket for psychological comfort. A word of caution: most routes are runout like the routes in Tuolumne! Rest assured, Power Dome claims several classics: 'Welcome To Courtright' (5.10a),  'A Little Nukey' (5.9-), Eve Laeger's route 'Esto Power' (.10d) and 'Consider Me Gone', a sphincter tighting 5.10c....tough for it's grade!\r\n\r\n-Punk Dome\r\n  +If your skills aren't in the highly honed catagory, Punk Dome will surely make a punk out of you! With nothing easier than 5.10, Punk Dome is located southeast from the reservoir (next to Penstemon and Dusy Domes). However, this dome has only four reported routes on it with loads of first ascent potential (ranging from 5.10-5.12). Recommended climb: 'Reach For the Sky' (5.11a) which starts at a bleached white section, on the left side of the dome.\r\n\r\n-Penstemon Dome\r\n   +Some liken this dome to a classic backcountry dome with only a 15 minute approach. This dome is located east of Punk Dome. Most routes are steep friction/edging climbs or crack corners. Highlights to Penstemon: Rope-A-Dope (5.8), Shake the Flake (5.9), Song Of The Earth (5.10a) and a route unnamed, left of 'Song Of The Earth'. The guidebook shows the crux to be 5.11 but has been downrated to .10b (at best).  \r\n\r\n-Dusy Dome\r\n  +Due to its proximity to Punk and Penstemon Domes, this dome is hardly frequented by climbers. Although it is host to many challenging steep slab climbs, Dusy shouldn't be passed up. Climbs range from 5.7 to 5.11a R/X. A couple of new routes have appeared since the SeKi guide was published. This page maintainer found a diamond in the rough that sent shivers down my spine and brought my Elvis shakey legs to life! This route, 'Champion Of None' (5.10b R), is located 30 feet left of 'Neener, Neener' . Immediately left of 'Chapion Of  None' is route called 'Kick, Thrash, Jab' (.10b). 'The amazing thing about Dusy......not a speck of exfoliation flakes, just super clean granite. Not to be  missed!\r\n\r\n-Voyager Rock\r\n  + Located directly east of the reservoir, this dome is where heros are made and cowards are sent home! Traditional by nature, Voyager features many crack routes and even a few aid lines (Doughballs On a Rampage 5.11a A2....put up by SP's very own, Kris Solem). This dome was once featured in an article of Climbing Magazine, exposing the hidden gems that Courtright features. Even Voyager's 'Ramp On' (5.6) makes for a wild challenge to the fledgling leader. Highlights to Voyager Rock: 'Smoke For Face' (5.11a, FA: Dwight Kroll) and 'By Jupiter, There Are Rings Around Uranus' (5.11d, FA: Herb Laeger and Kris Solem).\r\n\r\n-Locke Dome\r\n  +Named after the late Bob Locke, Locke Dome is the most remote of all domes at Courtright. Situated past the northeastern shoreline of Courtright Reservoir, Locke Dome has only three routes upon its flanks but contains loads of route potential. If your willing to make the effort, hiking or boating, Locke will pay dividends to any backcountry climber.\r\n\r\n-Leopold Dome\r\n  +Beyond the northern shore of Courtright is Leopold Dome. This dome has a wide array of climbs from beginner to expert. From crack to face, Leopold exhibits the same characteristics as Penstemon Dome. Most of the moderate climbs are well bolted and range from 5.7 to 5.8+. Don't miss some of the stiffer rated climbs such as 'Burnt Beyond Recognition' (5.10c), a total calf incinerator. Highlights to Leopold: 'Piss Flaps' (5.8+) and 'Sinners In The Hands Of An Angry God' (5.10b). \r\n\r\n-Trapper Dome\r\n  +If you haven't got your fill of sport climbs then Trapper Dome is where you want to go for \"clip and go\" routes. This dome is located on the western side of Courtright, left of the Trapper Springs Campground Rd. Within 10 minutes, you'll be cranking up high quality granite with generous amounts of fixed protection along the way. Even Trapper Dome's easiest route, Drill Instructor (5.4, 110 ft) covers 10 bolts to a chained belay!!! But as things stiffen up around its southwestern wall, you'll be praying for more, especially on routes like the 'Carson-Kodas Arete' (a super wild and exposed 5.11c). Highlights to Trapper Dome: 'I Wouldn't Wanna Be Like You' (5.10d/5.11b) , 'Zodiac Mind Warp' (5.10d) and 'Rhythm Divine' (5.10d).....all rating 4-star glory!\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=37.07589&amp;distance_lon_10=-118.97376&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.07589\u00b0N / 118.97376\u00b0W</a>", "Additional Provisions": "Wishon Reservoir (10 miles southeast) has additional resources available for that last minute, \"Oops, I forgot that!\", need. Located just prior to Wishon is the Wishon General Store. The store has a wide variety of goods (although fairly pricey) including wine and beer. Fuel, wood, fishing licenses ($10) and bait are also found there as well. Directly below the store is an RV campground that has coin operated showers (.75 cents per 5 minutes....but with an unlimited supply of hot water!) and coin operated washers and dryers, for that planned extended trip. Change to operate each can be acquired at the store as there are no change machines at the showers and laundry machines.\r\n\r\nAt the end of Dinkey Creek Rd., there is a small general store and gift shop called the Dinkey Creek Inn. Located on the right side, addtional provisions can be puchased there as well. They also serve a mean platter of chorizo and eggs. The Inn offers chalet rentals at anytime of the year ($85 daily on weekedays and $100 daily on weekends). The chalets can fit six people comfortably and houses a living room with fireplace, kitchen, bathroom, 2 bedrooms and a loft. Reservations are required.\r\n\r\n200 yards up from the Dinkey Creek Inn is a group campground managed by the USGF (walk-in sites available). Rates are $15 a night. This campground gives access to the Dinkey Creek trail that leads to Dinkey Dome, home to many challenging multi-pitch rock romps. See the Sequoia/Kings Canyon, Southern Sierra Rock Climbs guide for details.\r\n\r\nAs a word of warning, there is NO GAS service at either store. The \"last chance\" for gas is located in the town of Shaver Lake.\r\n\r\nAs for the town of Shaver Lake, be sure to check out the following \"grub stations\":\r\n\r\n* 'The Bru Ha Ha - they serve a New Belgium beer and make a damn good 1/2 lb cheeseburger.

{"When To Climb": "Because of the area's proximity to Highway 395, access to much of the Eastern Sierra is possible year round.  Needless to say, most of the peaks are substantially more demanding in winter and spring.  Travel at this time of the year involves generally longer approaches due to seasonal road closures, the possibility of snow/mixed climbing on normally moderate rock, and avalanche danger.  For all these reasons, May through October is the typical climbing season for most High Sierra peaks, with late June through early September attracting the majority of visitors.\r\n", "Mountain Conditions": "Weather conditions:  The NWS forecast is the most accurate for the region:  Mammoth Lakes area - Bishop area.\r\n\r\nWebcams:  Tioga Pass - Lee Vining - Mono Lake - Mammoth Lakes - Bishop\r\n\r\nUSFS/local conditions reports:  Mono Basin Update - Inyo NF northern area (Mono/Mammoth Ranger Districts) - Inyo NF southern area (White Mtn./Mt.

Reaching the trailheads themselves is more problematic without the former, although you may have luck hitchhiking; there are enough hikers, backpackers, and other outdoorsmen around to make finding a lift easier than in the city.  If unsuccessful with this, you can try one of several shuttle services around the east side; see below for details.\r\n\r\nSeveral major airports are found within a several hour drive of the east side:  San Jose (SJC), San Francisco (SFO), Los Angeles (LAX), or Reno (RNO).  Driving distances and times from the Bay Area and Southern California to the east side are fairly similar; Los Angeles is shortest for points south of Mammoth Lakes, San Jose/San Francisco is shortest for points north of there:\r\n\r\nDriving Mileages from Major AirportsBridgeportLee ViningMammoth LakesBishopBig PineIndependenceLone PineSFO (summer)230236263299314341356SFO (winter)284310338374388416 [1]431 [2]LAX360335313270255229213RNO110136164200215241257\r\n\r\nNotes:  SFO (winter) assumes SR50/SR207 to Minden, and then south on US395.

[2] 455mi via Walker Pass.\r\n\r\nBy car (Southern California)\r\n\r\nFrom Los Angeles, take SR14 north, which eventually merges with US395 just north of Walker Pass (SR178).  From San Diego and San Bernardino, take I-15 north until you reach US395.\r\n\r\nWinter access remains the same for Southern Californians, as good a reason for living down there as I've ever come across.\r\n\r\nBy car (Bay Area)\r\n\r\nIn summer, US395 can be reached easily from the Bay Area via Sonora Pass (SR108) for Bridgeport area destinations, or Tioga Pass (SR120) for Lee Vining and points south.  Crossing Tioga Pass requires either a park pass ($20/year for a Yosemite pass, or $50/year for a national parks pass), or that you drive through at night.  (The latter option is recommended so as to avoid the tourons in RVs, which you're otherwise guaranteed to encounter during daylight hours).  The Yosemite park entrance stations are typically unmanned between 8pm and 7am or so.  (A note:  The Big Oak Flat entrance station at the west end of Hwy 120 tends to be open later on Sunday evenings in the summer, until about 10pm or so, so plan accordingly if you don't have a park pass).\r\n\r\nBay Area folks face a longer drive to reach the east side once the main Sierra passes close, which typically happens some time in late October or early November, following the first major winter storm.  Salvation is found in the form of either Echo Summit/Kingsbury Grade (US50/NV207) or Carson Pass (SR88), both of which are kept open year round, with the exception of occasional closures due to avalanche danger.  This route, which reaches the east side via Minden, NV, is the quickest way to the High Sierra north of Independence when Sonora Pass and Tioga Pass are closed.  (Keep in mind that \"quickest\" is a relative term; this variation adds 2-3 hours of driving time vs. the standard summer drive.  Carson Pass is slightly shorter, but US50 over Echo Summit is generally a faster drive, even with South Lake Tahoe traffic).  Monitor Pass (SR89) generally opens some time in March or April, providing a shortcut in spring when taking the Carson Pass route; at this time of year, the drive to the east side is only 1.5 hours or so longer than in the summer.  Sonora Pass typically opens around Memorial Day weekend, and often provides access to the east side well before Tioga Pass opens.\r\n\r\nWinter/spring access from the Bay Area to the High Sierra south of Independence is still shortest mileage-wise via the northern passes (Echo Summit or Carson Pass), but is likely quickest via either Walker Pass (SR178) or Tehachapi Pass (SR58)--this is freeway almost the whole way.\r\n\r\nCaltrans maintains a list of historical closing and opening dates for the passes, as well as current road conditions for the Northern Sierra and Southern and Eastern Sierra.  You can also find additional opening/closing dates from previous years here, and historical data for Tioga Pass (SR120) going back to 1933 here.\r\n\r\nPublic transportation\r\n\r\nPublic transportation to the east side:  The YARTS shuttle bus runs from the town of Merced in the Central Valley to Yosemite Valley, and thence on to Lee Vining, June Lake, and Mammoth Lakes (and vice versa, of course).  Merced is serviced by both Amtrak, (800) USA-RAIL, and Greyhound, (800) 231-2222.\r\n\r\nPublic transportation along US395:  Inyo Mono Transit operates the CREST shuttle, which runs between Reno and Ridgecrest with stops at all the east side towns.  The CREST page contains information on both north and south connections.  Reno is serviced by Greyhound; Ridgecrest can be reached via public transportation by taking Greyhound to Mojave, and then taking a Kern regional bus to Ridgecrest from there.  Call Kern Regional Transit at (800) 881-5787, (800) 323-2396, or (800) 560-1733 for details about the latter; the schedule is also published online.\r\n\r\nInyo Mono Transit also operates a bus between Bishop and Lone Pine; contact them at (760) 872 1901 for more information.\r\n\r\nTrailhead shuttles\r\n\r\nAt one time or another, there have been several shuttle services on the east side, mostly based in Bishop.  I've no personal experience with these:\r\n\r\nKountry Korners Trailhead Shuttle Service, Bishop, (760) 872-3951 or (877) 656-0756.Mono-Inyo Dial-A-Ride, Bishop, (760) 872-1901 or (800) 922-1930.  Provides transportation to trailheads including Whitney Portal, Onion Valley, Taboose Creek, and North Lake.  $30/hour.Alpine Adventures, Bishop, (760) 873-5838.  $1/mile both ways from Bishop.\r\n", "Things To Do": "Besides playing in the mountains, the Eastern Sierra has a number of other activities to enjoy on that day off.  From north to south, some ideas are as follows:\r\n\r\nBodie State Historical Park, Bridgeport.  The ghost town of Bodie, an old gold mining community that rose and fell within a matter of years, is located southeast of Bridgeport.  The town is now preserved as a CA State Park--it is described as the \"best-preserved ghost town in the country\"--and is well worth the couple of hours of it takes to stroll around.  Take 395 south from Bridgeport for 7 miles, and turn east on SR270 for 13 miles (10 miles paved, 3 miles good dirt).  $3/person fee - a bargain.\r\n\r\nMono Lake Tufa State Reserve, Lee Vining.  Mono Lake Tufa State Reserve lies east of Yosemite, and was created to preserve the lake's famous tufa formations, strange calcium-carbonate spires that rise from the water.  It takes only an hour or so to walk around, but like Bodie, it's well worth the short visit.  $3/person fee.\r\n\r\nMountain biking, Mammoth Lakes.  The Mammoth Lakes area has a huge number of Forest Service roads and trails to ride, in a gorgeous setting.\r\n\r\nGalen Rowell's Mountain Light gallery, Bishop.  This is a must-see for anyone who needs to be humbled about his/her photography.  The gallery is located along the main street in Bishop.  No entrance fee.\r\n\r\nWhite Mountain Peak - Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, Big Pine.  White Mountain Peak is a short, easy hike, but what really makes the drive up there worthwhile are the stands of bristlecone pines you'll encounter on the way in, and in particular the Schulman Grove and Patriarch Grove.  Schulman Grove requires a small $2/adult fee, up to a maximum of $5/car, or is free with a Golden Eagle/Golden Age/Golden Access pass.\r\n\r\nRock climbing, Mammoth Lakes, Bishop and Lone Pine.  Owens Valley has a number of bouldering and cragging options if you're tired of backcountry climbing, including Crystal Crag (trad climbing outside Mammoth Lakes), the Buttermilks (mostly bouldering) and Owens River Gorge (mostly sport climbing), the latter two areas both located outside Bishop, or the Alabama Hills and Whitney Portal, both located west of Lone Pine.  Moderate trad and toproping options seem to be somewhat difficult to find in Owens Valley; your best bets for these are probably Crystal Crag, the area along Rock Creek road (there's some great cragging here, especially at Iris Slab; see Moynier's out-of-print Bishop Area Rock Climbs and Mammoth Area Rock Climbs for details), or the Alabama Hills.\r\n", "Object Title": "Eastern Sierra", "Major Trailheads": "The primary trailheads of interest to climbers in the Eastern Sierra are as follows, from north to south.  Driving directions for most of these trailheads can also be found on climber.org.  The starting point for all of the following directions is along Highway 395.\r\n\r\nBridgeport Ranger District (Toiyabe NF) - Bridgeport/Lee Vining area (Hoover Wilderness/Northern Yosemite)\r\n\r\nTwin Lakes (7100').  This is the starting point for the Horse Creek Canyon trail (Twin Peaks, Matterhorn Peak, Whorl Mountain, and the Sawtooth Ridge), and the Robinson Creek/Barney Lake trail (Ehrnbeck Peak, Hawksbeak Peak, Tower Peak, and Piute Mountain).  Turn south from Bridgeport at the Mini Mo-Mart gas station onto Twin Lakes Road and follow it 13 miles to its end at Mono Village resort.  Day use parking is free around the lake; overnight parking requires a $7/stay fee (pay in the campground or at Mono Village).\r\n\r\nGreen Creek (8000').  This trailhead is used to access the peaks around Virginia Pass, including Stanton Peak, Virginia Peak, and Twin Peaks.  Green Creek road is located off US395, about 4 miles south of Bridgeport and about 5 miles north of Conway Summit.  Follow the washboarded dirt road for 8 miles to the trailhead.  An official USFS campground is found 0.5 miles further along the road, or good rogue camping can be found at the trailhead.\r\n\r\nVirginia Lakes (9700').  This trailhead is used to access Dunderberg Peak, Excelsior Mountain, and Black Mountain.  Follow the paved Virginia Lakes road west from Conway Summit, a few miles north of Lee Vining.  The road is generally plowed to within a short distance of the trailhead some time in April, for the beginning of fishing season.\r\n\r\nSaddlebag Lake (10100').  This trailhead is used to access Excelsior Mountain, North Peak, and Mt. Conness.  The access road is located off Tioga Road 2 miles east of Tioga Pass, 10 miles west of Hwy 395. Most of the road is improved dirt, suitable for all autos. The day use lot is located at the south end of the lake near the dam. There is a small lot halfway along the access road which can be used for the Gardinsky Lake Trail to Tioga Peak. This trailhead is closed in winter, but is open from the east side in spring sooner than it is from the west.\r\n\r\nGlacier Canyon (9700'). The Glacier Canyon \"trailhead\" (there's no official trail, just an easy cross-country route) is located just past Tioga Lake on the east side of SR120; you'll find ample parking along the road here.  It is used primarily to access the Dana Couloir on Mt. Dana.\r\n\r\nTioga Pass (9900'). The pass is located on SR120, 12 miles west of Hwy 395 and 8 miles east of Tuolumne Meadows. This trailhead is used to access Mt. Dana to the south, and Gaylor Peak to the north. The pass marks the boundary with Yosemite National Park. If approaching from the east, you can park just east of the pass outside the park to avoid fees. Ample parking can be found along the roadway. This trailhead is closed in winter, but is open from the east side in spring sooner than it is from the west.\r\n\r\nMono Lake Ranger District (Inyo NF) - June Lake Area (Ansel Adams Wilderness)\r\n\r\nSilver Lake (7200').  The main trail of interest to climbers in this area is the Rush Creek trail out of Silver Lake, which can be used to approach Banner Peak, Mt. Davis, Rodgers Peak, Electra Peak, as well as Mt. Lyell and Mt. Maclure.  If coming from the south, turn left at the June Lake exit (SR158) and follow the road through the small community of June Lake to the obvious trailhead parking on the left. If coming from the north, drive a 5 miles south of Lee Vining and take the north entrance of June Lake Loop (SR158) for 9 miles past Grant Lake. The trailhead parking is on the right at Silver Lake.\r\n\r\nMammoth Ranger District (Inyo NF) - Mammoth Lakes Area (Ansel Adams Wilderness/Devils Postpile National Monument/John Muir Wilderness)\r\n\r\nAgnew Meadows (8300').  This trailhead is subject to considerable red tape, and car access must be timed to avoid road closure during the day; see above for details.  From Hwy 395, take SR203 west through Mammoth Lakes, and turn right onto Minaret Summit Road.  Drive to the summit, and continue another 2.6 miles to where the paved Minaret Summit Road does a hairpin turn south; turn right here along a dirt road to reach the trailhead, signposted for River Trail/Shadow Lake/PCT.  The trail is used to access the Minarets, Banner Peak, Mt. Ritter, and Mt. Davis.\r\n\r\nDevils Postpile (7500').  Like Agnews Meadow, this trailhead is subject to considerable red tape.  From Agnews Meadow, continue another 4 miles south along SR203 to the end of the road at Devils Postpile.  Day use parking is near the ranger cabin, overnight parking is a quarter mile north along the road. The trail is used to access the Minarets, Iron Mtn, and the Silver Divide. Nearby is the Reds Meadow  Pack Station. \r\n\r\nConvict Canyon (7600').  A few miles south of the Mammoth Lakes turnoff is a signed turn for Convict Lake; turn west here, and follow the paved road for 2 miles to the Convict Canyon trailhead parking.  Overnight parking is found here; day use parking is also available at the end of the paved road, on the southeast side of the lake.  (A use trail leads around the south side of the lake to reach the regular Convict Canyon trail).  This trailhead can be used to access Laurel Mountain, Bloody Mountain, Mt. Morrison, Mt. Baldwin, as well as Red Slate Mountain.  The lake is a popular fishing and boating spot, and there is a small store and restaurant here.\r\n\r\nWhite Mountain Ranger District (Inyo NF) - Toms Place/Bishop/Big Pine Area (John Muir Wilderness/Kings Canyon National Park)\r\n\r\nToms Place area:\r\n\r\nMcGee Creek (North) (8100').  A few miles south of the Convict Lake turnoff is another road on the west, well marked for McGee Creek.  Follow this road (paved at first, good gravel at the end) past a pack station to the large parking lot at its end.  This road and trail offer access to Mt. Morgan, Mt. Stanford, Red and White Mountain, Red Slate Mountain, as well as technical routes of dubious quality on Mt. Baldwin.\r\n\r\nLittle Lakes Valley (10200'), Hilton Creek (9800'), and Tamarack Lakes (9700').  A few miles east of Lake Crowley, you reach Toms Place, a tiny settlement with a bar, a payphone, possibly some drunken locals, and little else.  Rock Creek Road is found here, and is well signed; follow it to its end at Mosquito Flat (paved the whole way) to access the plethora of peaks around Little Lakes Valley, including Mt. Starr, Ruby Peak, Mt. Mills, Mt. Abbot, Mt. Dade, Mt. Gabb, and Bear Creek Spire.  On the drive up, a short way past Rock Creek Lake, just before the road becomes a 1-lane road with turnouts, you'll see parking on the right hand side; this is the Hilton Creek trailhead, used to access Mt. Morgan (N), Mt. Stanford, and Mt. Huntington.  To reach the Tamarack Lakes trailhead, used to climb Wheeler Peak, Broken Finger Peak, and Mt. Morgan (S), take a left at the paved road junction immediately prior to Rock Creek Lake.  The trailhead is well-signed and is located part way between the Lake Outlet campground and the Lake Inlet campground.\r\n\r\nBishop area:\r\n\r\nPine Creek (7400').  Approximately 10 miles north of Bishop is an exit for the small mining community of Rovana.  Take this exit (Pine Creek Road), drive through the town, and follow the paved road up to the trailhead.  This is used to approach the Granite Park area, including Mt. Julius Caesar, Merriam Peak, Royce Peak, and Feather Peak, as well as the northwest side of Mt. Tom.\r\n\r\nHorton Lakes (8100') and McGee Creek (South) (7900'-8600').  Follow SR168 (West Line Street) west out of Bishop for about 7.5 miles, and turn right onto unpaved Buttermilk Road.  Follow the road past several forks, keeping to the most traveled right fork when in doubt.  This is washboarded dirt, but passable to all passenger cars.\r\n\r\nTo access the Horton Lakes trailhead, turn right at a signed intersection for the trailhead, and follow the road for another 1.5 miles to a locked gate.  The road is rough, with some large boulders, but should be passable to most cars with some care.  (The last half mile is probably the worst; there is a good camping spot amongst some trees at this point).  This trailhead is used to access Basin Mountain, Mt. Tom, and Four Gables.\r\n\r\nTo reach the McGee Creek trailhead, used to climb Checkered Demon, Mt. Humphreys, and Mt. Emerson from the north and east, continue on the main Buttermilk Road instead of turning right at the aforementioned Horton Lakes trail junction.  There is a significant ford of McGee Creek at 7900' that may be an obstacle in the spring; abundant parking and good camping is found here.  (If you start hiking here, several log crossings are found a short way upstream to avoid getting your feet wet).  4WDs may be able to continue to the trailhead at 8600'.\r\n\r\nNorth Lake (9300').  Follow SR168 (West Line Street) west out of Bishop through Aspendell.  A little over a mile past this small village (limited supplies available there--food, sunscreen, etc.), there is a signed road on the right for North Lake.  Follow this narrow, winding road (a mixture of good dirt and pavement) to the large trailhead parking area on the righthand side, at the corral.  The Lamarck Col and Piute Pass trailhead is located about 1/2 mile west of here; hike along the remainder of the road and through the North Lake campground to reach this.  This trailhead is used to climb the Evolution peaks (Mt. Darwin, Mt. Mendel, etc.), as well as Mt. Emerson, Mt. Humphreys, and Mt. Goethe.  In spring, the road may be gated shut at SR168; this adds about 1.5miles and 300' gain on to your hike.\r\n\r\nLake Sabrina (9100').  Follow SR168 (West Line Street) west out of Bishop about 18.5 miles to the trailhead parking, on the left side of the road just before it ends at the dam.  This parking is limited to dayhikers; overnight parking is found 3/4 mile further back down the road at the North Lake turnoff.  The road is generally plowed some time in April ready for fishing season.  Lake Sabrina can be used to approach peaks on the crest between Mt. Darwin and Mt. Thompson, or to cross Echo Col, Wallace Col, or Haeckel-Wallace saddle to reach Evolution Basin and the Ionian Basin.\r\n\r\nSouth Lake (9800') and Parchers Resort (9300').  Follow SR168 (West Line Street) west out of Bishop to the signed South Lake turnoff on the left; follow this road (South Lake road) to the trailhead parking at road's end.  The Bishop Pass and Treasure Lakes trails are reached out of here; they are used to climb Mt. Gilbert, Mt. Johnson, Mt. Goode, Mt. Agassiz, and to approach the more remote peaks around Dusy Basin and Palisade Basin.\r\n\r\nThe Parchers Resort trailhead is located about 1.25 miles from the end of the road, a short way past the Tyee Lakes trailhead and Willow campground.  The road to this point is generally opened earlier in the spring than the other South Lake area trailheads, and as a result this is a viable starting point for a number of the preceding peaks if you head up here before the rest of the road is plowed.  In summer, this trailhead is used to climb Cloudripper from the north; park in the resort and follow the trail alongside the South Fork of Bishop Creek.\r\n\r\nBig Pine area:\r\n\r\nBig Pine Creek/Glacier Lodge (7800').  From Big Pine, take Crocker Road (Glacier Lodge Road) west for about 13 miles to road's end, where you'll find day use parking.  (Overnight parking is half a mile back along the road, on the north side).  Two trails are accessed from this trailhead:  North Fork Big Pine Creek (Temple Crag, Mt. Agassiz, Mt. Winchell, North Palisade, and Mt. Sill), and South Fork Big Pine Creek (Palisade Crest, Norman Clyde Peak, Middle Palisade, and Disappointment Peak).\r\n\r\nBirch Lake (7000').  From Big Pine, take Crocker Road (which becomes West Crocker Road, and then Glacier Lodge Road) for 2.6 miles west to McMurry Meadows Road.  Turn left on this signed dirt road, and then immediately turn left (southwest) again.  (The right fork parallels McMurry Meadows road, but is impassable).  Follow the McMurry Meadows road south for about 5.6 miles, turning to the right onto signed FS service road 9S03A (before you reach Birch Creek or McMurry Meadow).  Take this rough road (high clearance required) for about 0.5 mile to another intersection, where you turn left for a few hundred feet to a barbed wire gate.  Park here.  The Birch Lake trailhead is used to access Birch Mountain and the Thumb.\r\n\r\nRed Lake/Tinemaha Creek (6600').  From Big Pine, take Crocker Road (which becomes West Crocker Road, and then Glacier Lodge Road) west to McMurry Meadows Road.  Follow the directions on the Split Mtn. page to reach the trailhead.  (The USFS Bishop office also has excellent printed directions to reach both this trailhead and the Birch Lake trail, which are sufficient).  To access Tinemaha Creek (a cross-country route that can be used to climb Mt. Prater, Mt. Bolton Brown, and Mt. Tinemaha), take McMurry Meadows Road to the last fork below the start of the Red Lake trail.  The Red Lake trail is used to climb Split Mtn., Mt. Prater, and Mt. Tinemaha.\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney Ranger District (Inyo NF) - Big Pine/Independence/Lone Pine Area (John Muir Wilderness/Sequoia National Park)\r\n\r\nBig Pine area:\r\n\r\nTaboose Pass (5400').  The Taboose Pass trail leads to Taboose Pass (11400') and Cardinal Mtn., Goodale Mtn., and the Kings Canyon backcountry, including Arrow Peak, Upper Basin, and the Pinchot Pass area.  To get there, drive south from Big Pine to the signed turnoff on the right for Taboose Creek Road.  The road begins as rough pavement, but soon turns to gravel and good dirt.  Follow it to the first major unsigned intersection, and turn right, initially away from the creek.  This fork curves back towards the creek, reaches another intersection with the Goodale Creek road; stay right again.  Follow the road to where it dead-ends at the trailhead.  The 5400' starting elevation is not a typo; an early start is recommended.  You can expect to encounter a good deal of sand in the lower portions of the trail, and large rocks in the upper portions.\r\n\r\nIndependence area:\r\n\r\nSawmill Pass (4600') and Armstrong Canyon (5600'-8300').  Eighteen miles south of Big Pine, and eight miles north of Independence, is a 4-way intersection on 395 with Black Rock Springs Road.  Turn west on this road, and follow it 0.8 miles to a T-intersection with Tinemaha Road.  Turn right (north) here, and then left (west) in another 1.2 miles at Division Creek Road, following the signs to the Sawmill Pass trailhead.  This trail is used to access Colosseum Mtn., Mt. Cedric Wright, Mt. Perkins, and Mt. Baxter.  The 4600' starting elevation is unfortunately not a typo; start even earlier than you would for Taboose Pass!\r\n\r\nTo reach Armstrong Canyon, used to climb Mt. Pinchot, Mt. Perkins, and Colosseum Mtn., continue on the road past the Sawmill Pass trailhead, keeping right at the first fork encountered at 5500' (5.5 miles from the Hwy 395/Black Rock Spring Road junction).  A reasonable parking/camping area is found in another 0.7 miles at the 5600' elevation where the road turns south; from here, an old mining road (passable to most cars) continues up to the 8300' elevation in the canyon.  Keep right at the fork encountered at the 8000' elevation.  As of July 2005, rockfall blocked the road shortly past this fork, and it is advisable to park here.  Campsites are found in the trees at the end of the road.  A decent use trail starts up the south side of the canyon in the lefthand gully.\r\n\r\nBaxter Pass (6000').  Two miles north of Independence you'll find Fish Hatchery Road.  Turn west on this road, take the righthand fork at the first intersection, and follow it about 4.5 miles in all to its end, passing through Oak Creek Campground en route.  Trailhead parking is found here.  This trail is used to access Mt. Baxter, Diamond Peak, Black Mtn., and Mt. Mary Austin.\r\n\r\nOnion Valley (9200').  This trailhead is used to access the Kearsarge Pass trail (University Peak, East Vidette, Deerhorn Mountain, and Mt. Clarence King), the Golden Trout Lakes trail (Mt. Gould, Dragon Peak, and Kearsarge Peak), and the Robinson Lakes trail (Independence Peak and University Peak).  From Independence, turn west at the only traffic light, and follow paved Market Street for about 14 miles to the large parking area at the end of the road.  The former two trails are well signposted (follow the Kearsarge Pass trail a short way to reach the Golden Trout Lakes turnoff); the latter is more obscure, and is found by walking through the Onion Valley campground to its eastern end, where you'll find a sign that simply says \"trail.\"  The trail begins in campsite #8.\r\n\r\nShepherd Pass (6400').  From Independence, drive west on Market Street for 4.2 miles, before turning left on Foothill Road (gravel).  The road forks after 1.3 miles; take the right fork, and continue on this main road, ignoring side roads.  Continue about 1.5 miles further to a corral and a sign saying \"Symmes Creek\"; turn left here.\r\nAfter another 0.5 miles, you'll reach a signed junction for the Shepherd Pass trail; turn right here, and follow the road to the trailhead, keeping right at both forks.  The road is passable, with some care, to most passenger cars.  This trail is used to access Mt. Tyndall, Mt. Williamson, Junction Peak, as well as peaks in the Sequoia NP backcountry around the upper reaches of the Kern River (Milestone Mtn., Midway Mtn., etc.).  Although this trail has a reputation for being a hard hike, it is well-graded, and is generally one of the more pleasant of the high passes.\r\n\r\nGeorge Creek (6300').  George Creek is best approached with a 7.5' map in hand.  (Actually, it's probably best not approached at all, but if you must head out here...)  George Creek Road begins 5.3 miles south of Independence; head west on the dirt road, and follow it as it turns south past Manzanar Cemetery to a fork 2.5 miles from the highway.  Turn right here, and continue on the main road for another 5.0 miles to a junction.  The right fork leads to Bairs Creek; continue straight ahead for George Creek.  The trailhead is another 1.3 miles from this junction, but the road rapidly degrades past the next 0.5 miles, and many cars park here; the last 0.5 miles require high clearance 4WD and a good set of nerves.  George Creek itself has a reputation for being a brutal bushwhack, but this is overstated; there's a good use trail for much of the way, and the upper reaches are quite scenic.  This approach can be used to climb Mt. Williamson, Trojan Peak, Mt. Barnard, and Mt. Carl Heller.\r\n\r\nLone Pine area:\r\n\r\nWhitney Portal (8300').  From Lone Pine, take the Whitney Portal Road west to its end.  The Whitney Trail leaves here (abundant red tape required, see above), and is used to access Mt. Carillon, Mt. Russell, and the technical routes on Mt. Whitney via the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek, or Mt. Whitney, Mt. Muir, Mt. McAdie, or the technical routes on Thor Peak via the main trail.\r\n\r\nMeysan Lakes (7800').  The Meysan Lakes trail begins about a mile down the hill from the Mt. Whitney trail, along the main road; a small parking area and trailhead sign is found here on the south side of the road.  Follow the signs and your intuition through the campground and summer cabins to the start of the trail proper.  The Meysan Lakes trail can be used to access Mt. Irvine, Mt. Mallory, Mt. LeConte, Mt. Corcoran, and Lone Pine Peak.\r\n\r\nHorseshoe Meadows (9700'-9900').  From Lone Pine, drive three miles west on Whitney Portal Road to a signed junction with the Horseshoe Meadows road.  Turn left here, and follow it up many winding miles (22 in all from Lone Pine) to Horseshoe Meadow.  The New Army Pass trail (9700', access to Mt. Langley and Cirque Peak) is located at a signed turn-off about a mile before the end of the road; the Cottonwood Pass trail (9900', used to climb Joe Devel, Mt. Pickering, and Mt. Newcomb) begins at the end of the road.\r\n", "Overview": "\n            To a geologist, California's Sierra Nevada separates the Central Valley from the Great Basin, extending over 400 miles from Fredonyer Pass (CA 36 in Lassen County) in the north all the way to Tehachapi Pass (CA 58) in the south.  The range varies from 40 to 70 miles wide, much of which is rolling foothills and thickly forested slopes that lead gradually up the western side of the range to the crest.\r\n\r\nBut to the climber, the name Sierra conjures up images only of the dramatic eastern escarpment for which the range is justly famous, and in particular the high, rugged peaks found along the 130-mile portion of the crest between Bridgeport in the north and Lone Pine in the south.  This comparatively slender stretch of the range is the eastern Sierra -- or as it is more commonly known, the High Sierra.  It is a land of dramatic contrasts:  pristine wilderness that's located only a few hours drive from the millions of people packed like sardines in California's two major population centers; sagebrush desert transitioning within a matter of miles through forests, lakes, and meadows to barren rock and ice over 10,000 feet above the Owens Valley floor; the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere lying but some eighty miles from the highest point in the continental United States.  Almost the entire High Sierra is protected as federal wilderness:  Hoover Wilderness, Yosemite Wilderness, Ansel Adams Wilderness, John Muir Wilderness, and Sequoia/Kings Canyon Wilderness.  \r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the Sierra's geography, the long western approaches to reach the High Sierra have little of interest to the majority of climbers, and consequently most approach the region from the more dramatic eastern side.  As a result, access is primarily via US395, the major artery through the Owens Valley that runs alongside the High Sierra.  Several towns are found along this stretch of 395:  (north to south) Bridgeport, Lee Vining, June Lake, Mammoth Lakes, Bishop, Big Pine, Independence, and Lone Pine.  Bishop is the largest of these, offers by far the greatest choices for lodging, food, and supplies amongst all the east side towns, and as it's located at roughly the midway point between Bridgeport and Lone Pine, serves as the epicenter of a visit to the Eastern Sierra.\r\n\r\nIt is this area, the region covered by the 2-2.5 hour drive between Bridgeport and Lone Pine that surrounds Bishop, that is the focus of this page.\r\n", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Camping and Lodging": "As you might expect given the outstanding recreational opportunities in the area, there are abundant camping and lodging options along the east side.\r\n\r\nCamping\r\n\r\nInyo National Forest manages several dozen campgrounds between Lee Vining and the Lone Pine area, most which are fee sites.  There are also several Inyo County Campgrounds throughout the east side, all of which are also fee sites.  (My experience with these has been that you don't get a lot for your money, unless you enjoy paying for the privilege of sleeping in the dirt amongst ants and flies attracted to the sites by others' food and squalor.  On the bright side, at least it's easy to leave before fee collection in the morning).\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of cheaper options.  The BLM Bishop District manages several campgrounds along the east side.  As of last year (2004), these were free, with an optional donation at each; it appears that now (spring 2005), the BLM is also getting into the money making racket, and at least the Lone Pine campground is now $5/night.  They have no water or garbage collection, and are open from March or April through October.  From north to south, they are as follows:\r\n\r\nSouth Landing (Crowley Lake), 5.5 miles north and west of Toms Place.  Take Crowley Lake Drive to the campground.Horton Creek, 8.5 miles northwest of Bishop.  Drive west for 5 miles on Round Valley Road.Goodale Creek, 16 miles north of Independence.  Drive west for 2 miles on Aberdeen Cutoff Road.Tuttle Creek, Lone Pine.  Drive 3.5mi west on Whitney Portal Road, then turn left for 1.5mi on Horseshoe Meadows Road and follow the signs.\r\n\r\nFor those who prefer more solitude, dispersed (i.e. free) camping can be found throughout the National Forest Land on the east side.  Around Lee Vining, good spots can be found in the forest several miles east of 395, along Hwy 120 (east); just pick one of any number of dirt roads heading into the forest and you'll camp for free in complete peace and quiet.  Further south around Mammoth Lakes, free camping is found around the Glass Creek campground and in the forest further west.  In the Bishop area, quiet spots are found around the Buttermilks, with some particularly nice sites along the Horton Lakes road.  Take SR168 west to the Buttermilk Road, turn right, and drive until you find something appealing.\r\n\r\nYou can shower for a small fee at the Big Pine Bristlecone Motel (see below), or in Bishop at the Wash Tub laundry, off Main Street next to the library ($5/person).\r\n\r\nLodging\r\n\r\nLodging can be found in each of the east side towns.  In general, it is most expensive at either end of the High Sierra (Bridgeport, Lee Vining, and Lone Pine), becoming cheapest around Bishop and Big Pine.  In my experience, weekend rates around Bridgeport and Lee Vining tend to be $65+/night for a single, $40-45/night around Bishop and Big Pine, $50/night around Independence, and $55-60/night around Lone Pine.  (Needless to say, since most places along the east side are no more than an hour's drive from Bishop, I tend to stay around there).\r\n\r\nA list of Bishop motels can be found here and here.  In Bishop, the cheapest rates I've found have generally been at the Starlite Motel, located at 192 Short Street, (877) 873-4912 or (760) 873-4912; with a coupon, this is roughly $40-45/night for a single on a summer weekend night.  (You can find the same coupon in the printed \"Travel Coupon Guide,\" a yellow booklet that can be picked up in a number of Bishop fast food joints, including the Taco Bell and Burger King along Main Street).  Rooms include a small fridge and microwave.  Rates for a double (2 people/2 beds) in the town are also fairly reasonable, typically around $60/night at both the Starlite Motel and the Trees Motel (796 West Line Street, (760) 873-6391).  A caveat worth noting about the Starlite:  Inexplicably, there are no phones in the rooms!\r\n\r\nIn Big Pine, both the Bristlecone Motel (101 North Main Street, (760) 938-2067) and Big Pine Motel (360 South Main Street, (760) 938-2282) have good rates, typically around $45/night during a summer weekend for a single.  Again, both motels have a fridge and microwave in each room.  The Bristlecone Motel also has wireless Internet access (channel 6, SSID: linksys).\r\n\r\nOptions are more limited in Independence and Lone Pine; Ray's Den, (760) 878-2122, and the Courthouse Motel, (800) 801-0703 or (760) 878-2732, are generally the best bets in Independence (about $50/night, AAA rate).  Most of the more reasonable places in Lone Pine tend to be fully booked during the summer, so either get there early or plan on making reservations ahead of time.\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=37.36380&amp;distance_lon_10=-118.38590&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.36380\u00b0N / 118.3859\u00b0W</a>", "Maps": "In addition to the usual USGS 7.5' topographic maps covering the region, a number of other area maps can be useful:\r\n\r\nNational Forest maps:  Toiyabe National Forest (Bridgeport Ranger District) and Inyo National Forest both publish maps showing forest trails, roads, and land ownership within their areas of jurisdiction.  These two maps are not suitable for hiking or climbing purposes, but they are very useful for locating obscure Forest Service roads and area campgrounds.\r\n\r\nTopographic maps:  In addition to the National Forest maps described above, the Forest Service also publishes topographic maps (1:62500 scale) covering the Hoover Wilderness, Ansel Adams Wilderness, and John Muir/Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness.  The latter is huge, and not suitable for hiking, but is excellent for planning purposes.  It includes annotations showing the Bighorn Sheep Zone (see red tape above).\r\n\r\nTom Harrison Maps publishes a series of waterproof topographic maps (1:63,360, 80-foot contours) that covers the entire Eastern Sierra:  Hoover Wilderness Region, Yosemite High Country, Mammoth High Country, Mono Divide High Country, and Kings Canyon High Country.  They also publish a 1:125000 scale map (200-foot contours) covering Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park in its entirety.  These maps are particularly useful for planning as they include trail mileages.\r\n\r\nUSFS publications (the National Forest maps and USFS Wilderness maps) can be ordered online or over the phone from the Eastern Sierra Interpretive Association Bookstore, or purchased in person at any Eastern Sierra Ranger Station or your local outdoors store.  Tom Harrison Maps can be ordered online from the company's website (see link above), or found in most outdoors stores.\r\n\r\nFor last minute purchases on the east side, besides the local ranger stations, you'll find that several convenience stores along 395 also carry useful selections: The Shell station along 395 at the north end of Bishop sells the Tom Harrison maps covering the Eastern Sierra, and the Giggle Springs/Pace station along Main Street in downtown Bishop carries the USGS 1:100,000 series covering Bishop and the Mammoth Lakes/Benton Range areas.\r\n", "Further Information": "More information about food, lodging, and services can be found on the Eastern Sierra webpage, and at the Bishop Visitor's page.  You can find further information on the Mammoth Lakes region (conditions, services, and contact information) on the Mammoth Lakes Information page.\r\n", "Food, Gas, and Supplies": "One of the pleasant conveniences of a visit to the Eastern Sierra is the easy access to food and supplies.  Comprehensive information about food, lodging, and services can be found on the Eastern Sierra webpage.  Places of most interest to SPers are likely as follows:\r\n\r\nGroceries and general supplies\r\n\r\nMammoth Lakes and Bishop both have a good-sized Vons supermarket, each featuring a Starbucks cafe to keep addicts happy.  Locations are 481 Old Mammoth Road, Mammoth Lakes (hours 6am-1am), and 1190 North Main Street, Bishop (hours 5am-1am).  The remaining east side towns all have smaller independent markets/convenience stores with more limited hours--with the exception of the small market at the Lone Pine Chevron station, these are often not open before 6am or after 9pm.\r\n\r\nPetrol\r\n\r\nAlthough technically outside the scope of this page, the cheapest petrol in the Owens Valley for those approaching Lone Pine from the south is found at the Texaco Station in Olancha (possibly limited hours).  Along the stretch of 395 between Sonora Junction and Lone Pine, the cheapest petrol is found in Bishop, and in particular the Paiute Palace Casino on the north outskirts of town, followed by the Giggle Springs station on Main Street.  Petrol is more expensive, at times substantially so, in most of the other east-side towns; filling up in Bridgeport or Lee Vining in particular is recommended only on the most desperate of occasions.\r\n\r\nHiking and climbing gear\r\n\r\nLast-minute hiking and climbing equipment can be purchased/rented in Mammoth Lakes and Bishop:\r\nMammoth Mountaineering Supply, 3189 Main Street, Mammoth Lakes.  (760) 934-4191.Wilson's Eastside Sports, 224 North Main Street, Bishop (next to the Kava Coffeehouse--which incidentally has free wireless Internet access--and across from the Bishop Twin Movie Theater).  Hours:  9am-6pm, Sun-Thurs, and 9am-9pm, Fri-Sat.  (760) 873-7520.\r\nPlaces to eat\r\n\r\nChoices for good eating on the east side are somewhat limited, but the best places are outstanding and well worth the repeat visits you'll find yourself making.  If you're more concerned about eating cheaply than well, you'll find fast food choices in a subset of towns along 395:  Mammoth Lakes has a Carl's Jr., McDonalds, and Subway, Lone Pine has a Carl's Jr. and McDonalds, and Independence has a Subway.  Bishop has just about every fast food chain you can imagine, as well as a Denny's (open 24 hours), all located along the main drag (Hwy 395, aka Main Street).\r\n\r\nBridgeport:  Bridgeport dining options are somewhat limited; I've eaten at Pop's Galley a couple of times (fish 'n' chips, chicken, etc.), and it's not bad, with some decent fruit-flavoured milkshakes.  Located on the south side of the road, at 241 Main Street, Bridgeport.  (760) 932 1172.  JEFFMOORE adds:  \"Don't forget the Jolly Kone in Bridgeport under eateries, it's a gem!\"  I tried this per Jeff's suggestion, and I agree with his assessment--they have a great selection of burgers, Mexican food, ice cream, and other (very) high-calorie food.  You've gotta love a place that has an item on its menu called the \"Bucket o' meat.\"  Located at 178 Main Street, Bridgeport, just across the street from Pop's Galley; phone (760) 932 7555.\r\n\r\nLee Vining:  With its proximity to Yosemite and Mono Lake, Lee Vining is more of a tourist center, and as a result has more dining options.  Most of these are really unnecessary, because there's only one place where you'll find yourself eating again and again during the summer:  The Mobil Station found at the Hwy 120/US395 intersection, aka the Whoa Nellie Deli (deli hours 7am-8.45pm).  This is not to be missed!  The Whoa Nellie opens for fishing season (mid-April), and closes in the late fall with Tioga Pass' closure.  It's fairly pricey, but the food is excellent, the mango margaritas even better, and the ambience outstanding.  The surrounding store is open longer with the usual selection of prepackaged junk food (summer hours 6.30am-9pm), but be warned that there's a $5 minimum for credit card purchases.\r\n\r\nIf you must eat elsewhere in town, perhaps because you got back too late for the Whoa Nellie, Bodie Mike's Barbecue is decent and open until 10pm on the weekends, although I found portions to be small for the prices, especially after a day or two in the mountains.  Mono Cone is also recommended, especially their Frosties.  Nicely's has been consistently panned by everyone with whom I've spoken, although it's one of the few options if you visit in winter; its principal advantage is that it opens earlier than any other place in town (summer hours 6am-9pm).  I found breakfast there to be passable, but nothing special and not really worth it if you're on a budget; $7 for fairly forgettable eggs/bacon/pancakes.\r\n\r\nBishop:  In Bishop, Jack's is the classic eatery, and one will find both locals and climbers frequenting the establishment.  It's open from 6am through 9pm daily; highly recommended as a way of replenishing those lost calories.  Menu selections include a bewildering array of burgers, as well as a few other dishes (chicken, spaghetti, etc.)--typical diner fare, roughly $8-10/head.  The food here is so good that I've eaten at very few of the other local diners in town.  The only other such establishment I've tried is Amigos, located on the west side of Main Street just a block or two north of West Line Street (SR168).  This is a great Mexican place; the marinated chicken plate in particular was superb.  The only drawback is a lack of a liquor licence, so you won't find margaritas here. :-(  Prices are typically ~$8-10/plate, plus drinks.\r\n\r\nBig Pine:  Your best bets are to drive fifteen minutes up to Bishop, or bring your own food and cook yourself.  Options in town are limited to Rossi's Steak and Spaghetti Restaurant (relatively expensive at about $20/head, and pretty forgettable food), a pizza place I've never tried, or Country Kitchen Restaurant.  The latter is the best option in town with a typical diner menu, reasonable (if unexceptional) food, and decent portions for ~$10/head--but my main memories of the place are that every time we've been in there over the past several years, there's been the same, odd person sitting in the corner, whom we've yet to identify as either male or female.\r\n\r\nIndependence:  Aside from the Subway or food from the small markets, this small town boasts the Still Life Cafe--it features high prices, amazingly poor service, and is generally worth missing.\r\n\r\nLone Pine:  Many climbers eat at the Pizza Factory along the main drag (395).  Another good option is the High Sierra Cafe; food and prices are reasonable, but the main selling point might be the hours--it's open all night.  But the pride of the town is undoubtedly the Whitney Portal Store, which receives consistently good reviews.  Flipping through Peter Croft's The Good, The Great, and The Awesome, you'll find numerous entreaties to climb quickly in this area, in order to make it back to the portal for burger and fries... the man knows what he's talking about.  Try them once, and you'll understand what he means:  $7 for a cheeseburger and fries that are amazingly good for such a simple meal.  The store also boasts some truly huge pancakes that have become something of a legend when it comes to breakfast in the area.  (You really have to see them to believe them).  Hours vary throughout the year (see the store's website for current details), but are typically 9am-5pm in May and October, 8am-7pm in June and September, and 7am-8pm during July through August.\r\n\r\nRecycling\r\n\r\nAs you tour the east side, you'll probably accumulate a bunch of empty milk, juice, and beer bottles as you rehydrate.  You can recycle them in front of the Lee Vining Mobil station (i.e. the Whoa Nellie), at Mammoth Disposal, Inc. at 59 Commerce Drive, Mammoth Lakes, or at Manor Market along West Line Street (SR168, at the Shell station) in Bishop.

With only a few exceptions detailed below, dayhikers can explore the area unencumbered by bureacracy.  However, backpackers must obtain a wilderness permit from the Forest Service.  (Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks manage portions of the wilderness on the west side of the crest, but wilderness permits are handed out on a per-trailhead basis rather than on the basis of your eventual destination).  Contact the USFS ranger station responsible for your entry trailhead to procure the permit; this contact information can be found below.\r\n\r\nBetween May 1st and Nov 1st, there is generally a quota on each trail to limit the number of backpackers entering the backcountry each day; 60% of permits are reservable by contacting the Forest Service up to six months in advance, for a $5/person fee.  (There is one notable exception to this rule:  A $15/person fee applies for Whitney Zone permits, and 100% of permits for that trail are reservable ahead of time).  The remaining permits are obtainable free on a first come-first served basis, starting 11am the day before your hike.  Further details are found on the Inyo NF Wilderness Permit information page.\r\n\r\nIf camping in the back country, bear cannisters are required in many places throughout the High Sierra, particularly the popular trails, and campfires are generally prohibited above 10,000ft.  Current restrictions can be found in the Inyo NF Wilderness Regulations.\r\n\r\nArea-specific red tape\r\n\r\nA few areas in the Eastern Sierra have additional red tape as a result of their popularity and/or ecological concerns.  These are the region around Reds Meadow and Devils Postpile National Monument, west of Mammoth Lakes, the area around the Sierra Crest between Sawmill Pass and Vacation Pass, and the Mt. Whitney area, west of Lone Pine.  During the winter, Little Lakes Valley also has additional permit requirements.  From north to south, these details are as follows:\r\n\r\nReds Meadow area/Devils Postpile National Monument.  Minaret Road (SR 203) is closed to passenger vehicles beyond Minaret Summit from 7am to 7.30pm each day.  Between those times, visitors are required to ride a shuttle bus ($7/person) from the Mammoth Mountain Inn into Devils Postpile National Monument.  (See here for details).  The gates are unmanned outside these hours, and it is possible to drive in if you need to get an early start.  The shuttle bus runs throughout the valley; it's worth noting that the bus can be ridden for free within here, even if you've driven in, allowing for convenient shuttles between trailheads.\r\n\r\nIf you exit the Reds Meadow area when the gates are manned, you must pay the same per-person fee.  Note that despite the fact that the area is managed by the NPS, NPS park passes are not accepted here!  If this offends you, as it does me, it's possible to turn left before the gate to reach the Minaret Vista point, and then exit from the vista point on the other side of the gate, avoiding the attendant altogether.  Peaks affected by the Reds Meadow Valley closure include the Minarets, Mt. Ritter, Banner Peak, and Mt. Davis.\r\n\r\nLittle Lakes Valley.  There is no red tape for this area during summer.  However, during the winter months (typically November through April), Rock Creek Road is closed three miles east of Rock Creek Lake, and a California Sno-Park permit ($5/day, or $30/season) is required to park here at this time.  Fines for non-compliance are fairly stiff, $75 per infraction.  Peaks affected by this permit requirement include the peaks along the Sierra Crest between Mt. Mills and Bear Creek Spire, as well as the peaks around Pioneer Basin (Mt. Huntington, Mt. Stanford, and Mt. Morgan (N)).\r\n\r\nBighorn Sheep Zoological Area.  The area around the Sierra Crest between Sawmill Pass and Baxter Pass, and from Shepherd Pass to Vacation Pass, is closed seasonally/year-round to protect bighorn sheep.  (You also can't take your pet goat with you when you visit these areas!)  Restrictions are as follows:\r\n\r\nAll cross-country travel above 11,000' is prohibited east of the John Muir Trail and west of the Sierra crest from North Dragon Pass on the south to Sawmill Pass trail on the north year-round.All cross-country travel is prohibited in the basin south of Woods Lake, and a mile-long section north along the Sierra crest from Sawmill Pass and the 11,000' contour to the west.All cross-country travel is prohibited east of the Sierra crest between Dragon Peak and Sawmill Pass between July 1 and December 15.Williamson Bowl is open only between December 15 and July 15.George Creek and Mt. Williamson's SE Ridge are open only between Dec 15 and Jan 1, and between April 15 and May 15.\r\nThese areas are marked on the USFS wilderness map, \"A Guide to the John Muir Wilderness and Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness.\"  (This map, which is too large to use out on the trail but is excellent for planning purposes, may be ordered online from Sequoia National Forest).  The peaks affected by the closures include Dragon Peak, Dragon Tooth, Mt. Mary Austin, Black Mountain, Diamond Peak, Peak 3984m, Mt. Baxter, Acrodectes Peak, Peak 3914m, Peak 3903m, Indian Rock, Mt. Williamson, Mt. Barnard, Trojan Peak, and Mt. Carl Heller.\r\n\r\nMt. Whitney trail/North Fork of Lone Pine Creek.  These two trails are the exception to the rule that Sierra dayhikers are exempt from permit requirements.  Between May 1 and November 1, all hikers using the Mt. Whitney trail beyond Lone Pine Lake (about two miles in from the trailhead) are required to have a permit, regardless of whether your eventual destination is Mt. Whitney via the tourist route or one of any number of other peaks.  All permits for the trail are obtainable by reservation, and the popularity is such that a lottery is held to determine permit recipients.  (Any unclaimed permits are available on a walk-in basis as usual).  Peaks affected by this permit requirement include Mt. Whitney via the main trail, Mt. Muir, Mt. McAdie, Mt. Irvine, as well as the technical routes on Thor Peak.\r\n\r\nAs of 2007, visitors who plan on day hiking up the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek (e.g. to climb Mt. Russell, Mt. Whitney via the East Face/East Buttress/Mountaineer's Route, etc.) must carry a North Fork of Lone Pine day hike permit. This affects all visitors who will hike beyond Lower Boy Scout Lake. There is no quota set for these permits, so no reservation is needed.\r\n\r\nAs of this writing, according to several rangers it is legal to hike out on the Whitney trail after having ascended the Mountaineer's Route on Mt. Whitney, so you can safely return via this route at any time in good conscience.  If you need to use the Whitney trail to access your objective(s), but haven't obtained a permit--perhaps because the notion of doing so is offensive if you're not trudging up Whitney with the crowds, or perhaps because the idea of planning six months ahead strikes you as ludicrous--an early (substantially pre-dawn) start may avoid the rangers out on patrol.  Bob Burd notes that his group headed out at 5am on one occasion and encountered a ranger checking permits up at High Camp before 8am.\r\n", "Contact Information": "The Hoover Wilderness north of SR120 is managed by Toiyabe National Forest; the Eastern Sierra south of there is managed by Inyo National Forest.

The bus also comes where the train doesn't. If you're looking to go to Skye, or Glen Coe, or even Inverness from Fort William, the bus is the way to go. Also, the bus is about an hour faster on the Glasgow-Fort William route, although less comfortable.\r\n\r\nTimetables Citylink Busses\r\n\r\nGlasgow - Fort William - Skye\r\nOban - Fort William - Inverness \r\n\r\nLocal Busses\r\n\r\nLocal busses are provided by Highland Council, and operated by Rapsons.\r\n\r\nThese busses are fairly cheap, and serve the local area around Fort William. (Kinlochleven, Ballachulish, Glen Coe Village, Spean Bridge, Invergarry and Roybridge) Also they provide services in and around town.\r\n\r\nTimetables and further information can be viewed here\r\n\r\nBy Car\r\n\r\nGlasgow\r\n\r\nFrom Dumbarton: A82 Northbound to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdinburgh, Stirling and Fife (Newcastle)\r\n\r\nM9 to Stirling, A84/85 to Crianlarich, A82 Northbound to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nTayside\r\n\r\nArbroath; A92 -> Dundee; A90 -> Perth; A85 to Crianlarich, A82 Northbound to Fort William. \r\n\r\n\r\nEngland (Except Newcastle & Northumberland)\r\n\r\nCarlisle -> M74 Glasgow, A82 to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nAberdeen\r\n\r\nA96 to Keith, A95 to Kingussie, A86 to Spean Bridge, A82 to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nInverness\r\n\r\nA82 Southbound to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkye / Kyle of Lochalsh\r\n\r\nA87 to Invergarry, A82 to Fort William.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Foot\r\n\r\nFort William is the terminus of both the Great Glen way and the West Highland Way. \r\n\r\nAnother interesting walk-in is to get off at Corrour Station, cross Rannoch Moor, and entering through upper Glen Nevis. I've done this in 7 hours, but make sure you're equipped for an unexpected bivy, especially during winter. Although most of the trail is flatland, weather can hit hard in the Western Highlands, and on Rannoch Moor in particular. \r\nThere's a bothy at Staoineag, approximately 1,5-2 hours out of Corrour Station, administered by the MBA. Also, crossing the ford at Abhainn Rath, two miles up from Meannannach can be tricky, if not impossible in winter or after heavy rainfall.\r\n\r\nGreat Glen Way: Walking in from Inverness\r\n\r\nWest Highland Way: Walking in from Glasgow / Loch Lomond\r\n\r\nMountain Bothies Association: More info on bothies and how to use them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Air\r\n\r\nBy plane \r\n\r\nFort William is probably the only community its size in the Highlands without an airport. Nearest public airport is at Oban, thirty miles south, but from this airfield, and only since recently, one can only book flights to a handful of Inner Hebrides. Nearest airport with commercial service to places further afield is at Inverness. (Mostly UK and Ireland)\r\n\r\nMost low-cost carriers arrive at Prestwick, near Ayr, 45 minutes south of Glasgow. \r\n\r\nOther airlines usually fly in and out of Glasgow International airport, near Paisley, and Edinburgh International airport, just west of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nFrom Inverness there are busses running to Inverness city centre and Nairn.\r\nPrestwick airport has it's own SPT station, between Prestwick Town and Troon, where you can take a train to Glasgow (45 minutes) or Ayr (5 minutes)\r\nFrom Glasgow Int'l get a airport bus to Paisley Gilmour Street, and from there an SPT train onwards.\r\nFrom Edinburgh there are plenty of city busses running back and forth to the airport.\r\n\r\nBy Helicopter\r\n\r\nIf you're rich enough you can propbably fly in to Fort William by helicopter without breaking a leg first. \r\nUsually the only time when climbers or hikers fly into Fort William by helicopter is after they had an accident, or did something stupid in the hills and need airlifting to NHS Belford.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Boat\r\n\r\nThere's a marina in Fort William, and there's a foot ferry to Camusnagaul on the other side of Loch Linnhe. Marine options are fairly limited. Make sure you stay out of the Gulf of Corryvreckan when sailing in, unless you have balls the size of Jupiter, a death wish, or both. \r\n ", "About this page": "\n            Welcome to the Fort William Logistical Centre page here on Summitpost.\r\n\r\nThis page is an ongoing effort to provide up-to-date information necessary or useful to people wishing to use Fort William, and to a smaller extent, the greater Lochaber area, as their base for their outdoor activities. \r\n\r\nIf by any chance you know of anything that is useful for inclusion on this page, such as news relevant to outdoor enthusiasts in the Fort William area, or new hillwalker-friendly establishments in the area, drop me a message, and I will see to it. Relevant news will be posted in the bottom section, and if necessary, other sections will be updated to reflect changes to ensure that this page will be a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to Fort William and the beautiful hills around it.\r\n\r\nIn case you believe that entries are lacking in the amenities section, feel free to drop me a message about those as well. I do find it necessary though to keep this page simple and well-structured, and therefore, I will judge items by the following two rules before I include them;\r\n\r\nFirst; you must first ask yourself the following question: \"Will this be of any use to John Doe Climber?\" If it's not, it probably won't be included here. This is why Achintee Farm House is included, and Best Western isn't. Most climbers don't want to spend 100 quid per night 3 miles off the nearest trailhead, and the ones that do will probably already have booked it anyway. Places like these are simply not relevant enough, and besides that, it will only clutter this page and the last thing I want here is an unmanagable page with loads of useless information.\r\n\r\nSecond; if you request an addition, keep in mind that I only accept first hand experiences and absolutely no commercial advertisements or anything which resembles those. I will edit additions mercilessly if I think it's necessary. Also, if you have stayed somewhere and you have some bad experiences with some place, think by yourself; \"was it really bad, or was it my behaviour that caused it?\" I for example had an awkward moment in the Ben Nevis Inn once when I had gotten a wee bit too drunk after a nice day on the hills and decided that in order to fit under the showerhead, it would be better to bend the plumbing, instead of bending my knees a wee bit to fit underneath it. Needless to say, the owner wasn't too pleased, and the fact that he didn't bar me from ever staying there is in my opinion more worthy of a good review than a bad one for not being particularly outgoing towards his guest the next morning after I broke him the news. In any case, if I decide to include your news, additions or reviews on this page, you will of course be credited for it.\r\n\r\nI do hope that you will enjoy this page and find it a useful resource.  \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ", "The Basics": "Fort William is the largest city on the Scottish west coast north of Helensburgh.

In case fifteen minutes is too much to ask, a current weather report for Fort William, updated every 10 seconds is included below.\r\n\r\nA word of warning to first-time Nevis Range hillwalkers;\r\n\r\nDo note that conditions down in Fort William, Glen Nevis or even at the halfway Loch can be as different from those higher up in the hills as those in Greenland are from Florida. And in 99% of the cases Florida is down and Greenland is up. I've experienced warm, calm weather with mostly cloudy skies down in the Glen only to be \"surprised\" by a full-blown blizzard at the Carn Dearg plateau. \r\n\r\nSince most people visiting the area for the first time (and thus, more likely to be doing something that could lead to a embarrasing encounter with these folks ) are walking the tourist trail, use as a rule of thumb that if the wind picks up mercilessly by the halfway Loch, (sudden sustained jump of more than 3 beaufort from the point where the trail starts bending \"inward\" to the saddle) as well as an increased intensity of precipitation at this point, the weather is likely to deteriorate much more further up. If you are not equipped for this, or even in doubt, turn around before the crossing of the Red Burn.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you are not familiar with the mountain, experienced with, and equipped for the weather, you have no business being up there if there is more than 50 mph winds, less than 100 yards of visibility, or heavy preciptation already at the halfway Loch. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if it's raining heavily at 600 meters, with the ceiling being down to 900 meters or less and high winds what the conditions at the summit might be.

This simple representation is not enough for such a versatile area and the most popular trialhead in the entire range. \r\n\r\nIn 1890 a man named Henry Van Hoevenberg opened the original Adirondack LOJ. He built trails leading from the LOJ to the surrounding high peaks. This would be 19 years before the Long Trail was concieved and 31 years before the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\r\nMr. Van Hoevenberg influenced many of the earliest recreational hikers in this area, teaching them about the land, spending time around campfires telling stories and creating a backwoods charm that helped allow this place to become what it is today, a multiple use area with many types of accomodation and an information center that can be used year round by families or backcountry enthusiasts launching a trip into the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe main trail that leads from this area to the top of Mt. Marcy (New York's Highest) bears mr. Van Hoevenbergs name. \r\n\r\nThe LOJ itself is only one type of accomodation here.

In summer there is swimming, boating, and fishing in Heart Lake.\r\nThere are educational programs, guided walks, slide shows, campfires, and a nature museum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn winter there are many trails designated for cross country skiing that surround the LOJ and enter the backcountry, as well as limitless snowshoeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adirondack Mountain Club Provides these programs and many others. To learn more about the ADK see the section below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is also the closest trailhead to Mt. Marcy. The hiking and backcountry camping are excellent.

{"Activities": "Huaraz is the center for outdoor activities in Peru.  Along with mountaineering, Huaraz serves as the base for trekking, rock climbing, paragliding, rafting and more.  Listed below are some of the more popular peaks (many more are available in other Summitpost pages) and treks.  The list is not meant to be exhaustive.  Also while in Huaraz, there are excellent opportunities to relax or take in some local history.\n\nHuascaran Sur: Peru\u2019s highest mountain dominates the Callejon de Huaylas.\n\nAlpamayo: Considered one of the world\u2019s most beautiful mountains.\n\nArtesonraju: Often cited as the mountain in the Paramount logo.\n\nSanta Cruz Trek: A 3-4 trek through the Santa Cruz valley, up over the Punta Union pass at 4,500m.  This is probably the most popular trek in the region.\n\nHuayhuash Circuit Trek: A challenging 10-14 day trek circumnavigating the Huayhuash range.  Demanding and beautiful.\n\nRock Climbing: With at least a hundred routes and more every year, Hatun Machay (sport climbing) is becoming more and more popular.  Sitting at 4200m, it can be a good spot to acclimatize. Other small crags are scattered around Huaraz, but this one is probably the best.  New big lines are being developed in the Cordillera Blanca every year, although rock climbing is still in its infancy. <\nA small section of Hatun Machay\nChavin Archaeological Site: Pre-Incan ruins make for a nice side trip.  Many other archaeological sites are near Huaraz.\n\nHot Springs: Several hot springs around Huaraz offer a nice way to relax on an off day.  The hot springs at Monterrey are just a short taxi ride or a 6 km hike from Huaraz.\n\nMountain Biking:  Enjoy the mountains on wheels!  If you want to relax, you can get a ride to the top of the Cordillera Negra, get great panoramic views of the Cordillera Blanca, and ride all the way back down to town.\n\nDayhikes: Numerous dayhikes are possible from Huaraz.  If you have bigger objectives in mind, these can be valuable for acclimatization.  One of the most popular is to Laguna Churup.\n\n", "Climate": "\u00a0\nTypical weather conditions in Huaraz and the Cordillera Blanca: Blue skies with some scattered afternoon clouds.At just 9.5 degrees south, and 3,090 meters, the temperatures in Huaraz are surprisingly moderate and consistent.  Average monthly temperatures vary by just 2 degrees C (from 13.5 to 15.5).  Typical daily highs are around 20 C, with nighttime lows around 5 C.  Note that these temperatures are in town.  A 5,000m, the typical elevation for a high camp in the Cordillera Blanca, nighttime lows can reach -20 C.\n\nThe best time to visit if from June through early September, corresponding to the dry \u201cAndean Summer.\u201d  Typically during this time, the weather is remarkably stable with little precipitation.  However, don\u2019t take this for granted.  During El Nino years, the seasonal weather patterns can be considerable disrupted.  During the wet season (November through April), it is common to see precipitation daily.\n\nInternet weather forecasts can be unreliable since the mountains create their own microclimate, however, they can still sometime be useful to identify trends. Accuweather provides local forecasts.  The Peruvian weather service can also be helpful. \n\n", "Getting There": "Almost all international travelers will enter Peru via the Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima.  From Lima, Huaraz is accessible by plane or bus.  Huaraz is located about 420 km north of Lima.\n\nFlights from Lima land at a small airstrip about a 20 minute drive north of the center of town. LC Busre operates these flights, which run just over $100 one way. Be aware that luggage restrictions may be prohibitive if you have many bags.\n\nThe two most popular bus services are Cruz del Sur and Movil Tours. The bus from Lima takes about 7-8 hours and costs about $25 (reservations can be made online, although not all itineraries will be shown if you look well before the date). The seats on these buses are quite comfortable and it is reasonable to expect to get some sleep if taking the night bus. First class seats are available for a few dollars extra and offer more space and even more comfortable leather chairs.  There are many other options for bus services with varying quality of service.\n\nIf you\u2019re desperate, you could hire a taxi, but expect to pay at least $200.\n\n", "Emergency Services Contact Information": "Victor Ramos Guardia Hospital: Luzuriaga Ave, Block #8.

They are easy to find in Huaraz.  In 2009, Skyline Adventure School released new maps (also north and south) specifically for trekkers and climbers.  They are cheaper, more up-to-date, waterproof, a more manageable size, and include climber-specific information.  These can be bought directly from Skyline (also see an online preview), or purchased in Huaraz at a variety of locations.\n\n", "General Information": "What to ExpectVisitors to Huaraz should be respectful and open-minded, as things don\u2019t always work as you\u2019d expect. Crowding 20 people into a 15 passenger van (\"Colectivo\"), is common practice.  You will hear more honking horns than in New York City.  Don\u2019t be surprised if things aren\u2019t running on time.  Don\u2019t get angry when the store you\u2019re trying to find is closed (siesta system).  If things don\u2019t meet your standard of hygiene, you can always go back to your office.  Don\u2019t worry about paying a small fee or tax to a rural community; while it may not make its way into the right hands, the locals probably need it more than you do.  Many things are constantly under construction, from roads to buildings, and the projects will continue well into the future.  There aren\u2019t too many rules on the road; if you\u2019re in the bigger vehicle, you\u2019ll be alright. Expect a parade to come down the street on any day of the week.   In Peru and Huaraz, I\u2019ve learned to expect the unexpected.  Once you spend some time there, you will cherish the eccentricities.  Eventually, you will be longing to return and Huaraz will hold a special place in your heart.\n\nSafetyWhile Peru is considered a third world country, it is rapidly growing and becoming more accessible to foreign travelers.  Tourism to Peru and Huaraz has steadily increased as the threat of the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerilla movement, at its height in the late 1980's and early 1990's, has been eliminated.  The people of Peru are generally very friendly and eager to serve tourists, as the industry is essential for economic growth.  I have always felt very safe while traveling and in Huaraz.  At the same time, don\u2019t be foolish (expensive accessories stand out).  Keep valuable locked up when possible and be aware of your surroundings.  Follow the same precautions you would if you were travelling anywhere else.\n\nTravel DocumentsA valid passport is needed to enter Peru.  For stays shorter than 90 days, a visa is granted on the spot at the airport.  You may wish to carry copies of your passport with you, keeping the passport itself in a safe location.  A passport (copy ok) is needed to obtain a park pass and it is a good idea to have a copy when you are going through a park checkpoint. More travel document information can be found here.\n\nAltitudeHuaraz sits 3,090 m (10,138 ft) above sea level.  Thus, it is a good idea to spend a few days in town to acclimate before heading out for an adventure.  While you are in a city, don\u2019t forget to take the normal precautions you would if you were at altitude in the mountains.\n\nLanguage\u00a0\nHappiness is a 'Caramello' when trekking through rural villages surrounding HuarazPeru is a geographically diverse country, ranging from the dry coastal desert, to the magnificent Andean highlands, to Amazon Basin.  Peru is home to 26 million people, a mix of descendents of Incan natives to Spanish conquistadors.  Thus, both Spanish (used in cities and some rural areas) and Quechua (used in some rural areas) are the official languages.  While those involved with the tourist industry may speak English, it is not a guarantee.  Your best effort to speak to local language is generally appreciated.\n\nTimePeru is in the Eastern Time Zone, although they do not participate in daylight savings time.  Sitting at 9.5 degrees south of the equator, in Huaraz the sun will rise around 6:00AM and set at 6:00PM year-round.  \n\nCurrencyThe Peruvian currency is the Nuevo Sol (S/.), often shortened to just \u201cSol\u201d.  The exchange rate typically hovers around 3 S/. = 1 $US.  Money can be changed upon arrival at the airport in Lima, or many ATMs are available in Huaraz.  The ATMs will give you the current exchange rate, but be sure to check with your own bank to see if any fees will be charged.  The ATMs will dispense Sols or Dollars, but only Sols are generally accepted at local businesses.  While ATM\u2019s will dispense 100 S/. notes, they can be hard to use because counterfeiting can be a problem.  It is a good strategy to break the big bills when you can, trying to conserve smaller bills and coins for smaller purchases. I have never received a fake note from an ATM.  Credit cards are accepted at tourist locations (the bus companies, lodging, some restaurants, guide services, etc.), but don\u2019t expect to use one in small local stores.\n\nElectricityElectricity in Peru is supplied at 220V using a South American socket.  Bring an inverter if you have devices that you need to charge that will only run at 120V.\n\nTelephoneCell phones are everywhere in Peru, and you can easily pick one up to use during your stay.  Service in Huaraz is good and extends a bit into the foothills.  The country code for Peru is 51. The departmental code for Huaraz is 043.\n\n", "Health": "General PrecautionsOne of the biggest challenges of a trip to the Cordillera Blanca or Huayhuash is staying healthy.  Combining a weakened immune system at altitude, varying standards of sanitation and hygiene, and bacteria that is unfamiliar to your body is a perfect recipe for illness.  The \u2018Huaraz Bug\u2019 can result in a long day with frequent trips to the restroom or it can force a return trip home.  From my anecdotal analysis, a majority of people will experience some form of sickness during a stay in Huaraz.  A smaller but not insignificant number will have severe problems that ruin the trip.  So, how can this be avoided?\n\nThe obvious warning that anyone receives when travelling in the third world is \u201cDon\u2019t drink the water.\u201d   Bottled water is widely available in Huaraz.  It is cheaper to buy the large 2.5 L bottles (~2.4 S/.) and use them to fill smaller bottles.  Restaurants will all serve bottled water.  It is also important to use bottled water when brushing your teeth.\n  \nWhen heading into the valleys, it is essential to THOROUGHLY treat the water.  The valleys are typically used as pastures for animals and thus are littered with feces.   I know boiling and treating the water work, but I\u2019ve found, for peace of mind, that I prefer to carry some extra bottled water from town to last me, if possible, to where I am above the cows.\n\nBeyond water, be cautious of what you eat.  The restaurants frequented by tourists are generally safe, but the small stands on the street may not be.  I have bought, cooked, and eaten meat from the open-air market and been fine.  If you chose to do this, it is best to buy the meat early in the day and from stands that refrigerate the meat.\n\nDuring my first trip to Huaraz, I wasn\u2019t too vigilant with watching what I ate and drank.  I ended up getting sick.  It wasn\u2019t enough to send me home ahead of schedule, but it was enough to make me miserable at times and turn me around on a climb.  When I visited in 2009, I was vigilant about washing my hands:  before meals, during meals, after meals, wake-up, after using a computer, after showering, etc.  I used more instant hand sanitizer than in the rest of my life combined.  I didn\u2019t get sick once during a 3 week stay.\n\nAnother preventative option, and one that I have used, is taking Pepto-Bismol as a prophylactic.  If you plan to do this, you should consult a doctor.\n\nMedicineMedicine is available (cheaply) in Huaraz, including powerful antibiotics.  However, it is not a bad idea to get some prescriptions from your regular doctor. \n\nVaccinationsIf you look it up on the internet, you will be told that you need Malaria and other vaccinations if you travel to Peru.  However, if you are only going to Huaraz, there is minimal risk of contracting Malaria due to the altitude.  Thus, the anti-malaria drugs are probably not necessary.  Then again, I\u2019m not a doctor.\n\nHealthcareHuaraz has both a hospital and 24-hour clinic.  Use at your own risk. Americans should always check with their insurance provider before travelling to foreign countries to determine coverage.\n\n", "Location": "Peru, South America", "Around Town": "Huaraz has many options for all services and I have certainly not personally evaluated all of them.  Below is a list of places that I know are popular among other travelers.  I have designated my personal recommendations with an asterisk (**) as well.  Other opinions may vary.  Prices are from 2009.\n\nHuaraz is a very walkable town.  Just about anything can be reached with a 20 minute walk.  Taxi\u2019s are easy to pick up (you will be honked at if you are walking down the street), just hold up a hand or look like you might need a ride.  They shouldn\u2019t cost more than 2 S/. \n\nFloating around town you will find a Huaraz pocket map/guide.  This is very helpful for getting around town and also includes some interesting stories and other useful information.\n\nAv. Luzuriaga, the main street of Huaraz\nVendors set up along a side street\nLodgingLodging in Huaraz is not hard to come by and there is a range of options for all budgets.  Space in a bunk room can be found for 10 S/.  More comfortable accommodations (private rooms, private bath) that will not break the bank are also available.  For extended stays, it is possible to find a room to rent in a house.\n\n**Olaza\u2019s Bed and Breakfast (Private double room, two twin beds 80 S/. per night): A very popular place for climbers and trekkers.  Clean rooms, hot showers, rooftop patio, lounge area, free internet, movies, books, will store bags while you are out in the hills, laundry facilities, etc.  Tito, Rosa, and Teo are extremely helpful.  I give it my highest recommendation.   It is best to book ahead as the rooms are often booked full during the high season.\n\nLa Casa de Zarela (Private rooms, similar prices to Olaza\u2019s): Located across the street from Olaza\u2019s, this is another nice looking place.\n\nAlbergue Churup (25 S/. for a bunk, 90 S/. for a private double room): Another full service hostel with a bit more space.\n\nEl Tambo (10 S/. for a bunk): One of the cheaper places in Huaraz, it still has reasonable accommodations.  Loacated at Av. Confraternidad Oeste #122, down near the market and the stadium.\n\n\u00a0\nA plate of Cuy\u00a0\nPollo a la Brasa, a perfect post-climb meal, and it's only about 3$.\u00a0\nThe famous \"Sex Burger\"\u00a0\nShots of Pisco at 13 BuhosRestaurantsHuaraz may be a small town in Peru, but I have found the food to be excellent fuel for long days in the mountains.   A \u201cfood tour\u201d of Huaraz on a rest day can be a very satisfying experience. There are dozens of quality restaurants, some of which cater to tourists and some of which are frequented by locals.  Prices range from 6 S/. a plate to 45 S/. per plate.  Tipping is not expected, but if you get great service it\u2019s not a bad idea to round your bill up a bit.\n\nPeru follows the siesta system, and restaurants follow this system as well.  Late, extended lunches can last a few hours and dinner is typically around 8 or 9 PM.  In general, food will come out at a slower pace than the American standard.  You will be attended to until you ask for the bill (\u201cla cuenta por favor\u201d).\n\n\u201cCuy\u201d (Guinea Pig) is dish popular among locals.  You may not like it, but at a minimum it\u2019s worth trying for the cultural experience.\n\n**Caf\u00e9 Andino  (~15-30 S/.): An excellent place to grab breakfast, lunch, or dinner and relax.  Music, library, games, and a killer view of the mountains.  Run by Chris Benway, who is also an excellent source of information.\n\n**La Brasa  Roja (~10-15 S/.): With a menu that includes just about anything you can think of, generous portions, and reasonable prices, this place is popular with both travelers and locals.\n\nBistro de los Andes: Situated prominently across from the Plaza de Armas, they serve Peruvian dishes including quinoa soup and the best aji de gallina in town. [Recommendation by SP user Buz Groshong]\n\nSiam de los Andes (~40 S/.): Excellent authentic Thai food, prepared by an authentic Thai chef.  A bit more expensive, but absolutely well worth it.\n\nEncuentro (~15-20 S/.): There are many different varieties of this restaurant with varying atmospheres.  All serve a pretty good meal.\n\nEl Horno (~15-20 S/.): Brick oven pizza, among other items.\n\nPizza BB (~15 S/.): The closest to American-style pizza I\u2019ve found in Huaraz.\n\nSex Burger (~5 S/.): Yes, the name is correct, it\u2019s Sex Burger.  A classic late night snack stand, your appreciation for your food may depend on your level of inebriation. \n\n\u201cChifa\u201d (~5-8 S/.): There are dozens of Chifa\u2019s (Chinese food) scattered around Huaraz.  They are generally cheap.\n\n\u201cPollo a la Brasa\u201d (~6-10 S/.): Rotisserie Chicken is a specialty in Huaraz.  Some restaurants have a simple menu: \u00bc chicken, \u00bd chicen, whole chicken.  It will probably be some of the best chicken you have ever had.  There are many small restaurants throughout Huaraz, but one of my favorites is just around the corner from Olaza\u2019s.\n\nNightlifeHuaraz nightlife is alive and kickin\u2019.  Whether you want to dance the night away or just have a beer and chat with climbers from all over the world, there is something for you.  After a few night in town, you may find the mountains a welcome relief.\n\n**13 Buhos: My favorite place to hang out in Huaraz.  Friendly service, good music, and good homemade beer.  Located above the Makondo bar across from the Cruz del Sur bus station.\n\nX-treme Bar: A Huaraz classic.  Also hosts movie nights on some evenings.\n\nVagamundo: Another popular bar.\n\nEl Tambo: Dance the night away in this popular and famous Huaraz hotspot.\n\nFood (for the mountains)What\u2019s available: pastas, dried fruit, rice, beans, cookies, drink mixes, soups, meats, cheeses, breads, nuts, cereals, oatmeal, sauces, chocolate, fresh fruit, potatoes, candy bars.\n\nWhat\u2019s not available: Energy bars/gels/beans.\n\nHuaraz has a couple supermarkets, but the cheapest place to get food is the \u201cMercado\u201d a big covered building with hundreds of stalls.  At the Mercado you can find everything from freshly butchered meats, to canned goods, to dry food, to breads, to wine, to clothing, to household appliances.  If you\u2019re buying in large quantities, you might be able to haggle a bit, but the prices are generally very reasonable.  You will find a mix of American brands (Oreo\u2019s, Chips Ahoy, Kraft Mac & Cheese, etc) and local brands.  The local foods will typically be cheaper.  Stores, including the Mercado will typically open before 7:00 AM, staying open until around 8:00 PM.  However, most stores will close from around 1:00-3:00 PM for siesta.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0FuelBoth butane canisters and white gas (\u201cbencina blanca\u201d) are readily available in Huaraz.  Most of the outfitters/guide services will sell butane canisters (8 oz canister ~ 15 S/.)  Bencina blanca (~6 soles/liter) can be found at hardware stores (\u201cferreter\u00eda\u201d), which are generally clustered along Avenida Raymondi near the Mercado.   Some stores sell prepackaged, labeled bottles.  For others you must bring your own container.\n\nGearNew gear is readily available in Huaraz, and what is there is pretty expensive.  Used gear is easier to find, and rental gear is fairly common.  Search around for the best prices and best quality.  As with most other things, there are rarely price labels and prices are rarely fixed.  Things that can be rented include tents, stoves, sleeping bags, backpacks, crampons, harnesses, pickets, ropes, headlamps, boots, axes and more.  Be prudent and safe.\n\nHomemade pickets can be picked up in Huaraz. For about ~25 S/. you can get a 24\u201d aluminum angle, cut at an angle on the end with a whole drilled in the other end.  For a bit more, you can get a fancier model with holes drilled along the length and a bit of reinforcement on the hammering end.\n\nBamboo can be purchased to make wands.  As with most goods, all the bamboo sellers are grouped together near the intersection of Raymondi and Confraternidad Oeste.  1-2 S/. will get you all you need.\n\nGuidesThere are many full service guide agencies available in Huaraz, with quality and price varying.  If you walk down the street, you won\u2019t have a problem finding one as they will likely be asking you if you are interested.  The same treks and climbs will be offered at almost all agencies.  If you go with an agency, be sure to investigate what is included for the price.  Typically, these services include transportation, cooks, porters, arrieros, etc.  Also, be aware that someone on the street referring you to a guide agency is likely receiving a commission. \n\nAs with anywhere, personal recommendations are extremely valuable in determining the quality of a service.  I highly recommend Skyline Adventure School.  It is a truly high-class organization that will bend over backwards to make your trip memorable and successful. Skyline, along with some of the other agencies can just arrange logistics if you don't need a guide during your climb.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go with a full-service guiding agency, it is possible to hire just a guide.  Inquire at the Casa de Guias.  In this situation, you are typically expected to provide (or rent) everything other than the guide\u2019s personal technical equipment.  The Peruvian Mountain Guide Association works with the Swiss Mountain Guide Association to improve the quality of local guides, which is generally pretty good.\n\nMountain ConditionsThe best place to find current conditions is the Casa de Guias (by Parque Ginebra, not far from Av. Luzuriaga).\n\nPark Office and RegulationsThe Cordillera Blanca lies predominantly within the Parque Nacional Huascaran (English | Spanish).   Entry into the park requires a park pass (a 30 day pass costs 65 S/., day passes also available), which must be shown at checkpoints throughout the park.  Although they can be purchased at the checkpoints, it is easiest to purchase a pass ahead of time at the park office in Huaraz.   The office is located on Sal Y Rosas, just west of the main street, Avenida Luzuriaga, in a relatively non-descript building.  When you purchase a pass, be sure to note the park regulations.  Most notably, fires are prohibited in the park.\n\nOver the last several years, park regulations have been in flux.  At one point, the park administration declared that all visitors must hire a guide recognized by the park, even just for trekking.  This created a bit of an uproar in the climbing community since many people do not require a guide.  Recently, the UIAA has worked with the park administration to allow members of UIAA-affiliated clubs (AAC, BMC, etc) entrance into the park without a guide.  You must have your ID card for your organization at the time you purchase your park pass (the AAC also provides a letter than can be printed from its website).  While there is supposedly a 30-day advance registration requirement, I have never seen or heard of this being enforced (it\u2019d be nearly impossible to obtain a pass if it was).  In 2009, with my passport and AAC membership card, I had no problem getting the pass at the park office and no problems at any of the checkpoints.\n\nTransportationThe Callejon de Huaylas runs roughly north-south, with a series of valleys running east-west into the heart of the Cordillera Blanca.  The furthest valleys are about a half-day journey from Huaraz, with the closest within walking distance or a short drive.\n\nMost, if not all, of the valleys can be reached using the Colectivo system.  These are large vans which will carry more passengers than you think possible.  They typically leave on a schedule for a designated location in Huaraz (varies based on the destination, but most leave from a plaza where Avenida Fitzcarrald crosses the Rio Quilcay), although the driver could leave early or late depending if he is satisfied with the number of passengers on board.  The driver and the doorman work together to drop off and pick up passengers as necessary.  A collective ride is cheap and generally quick, although there is no guarantee of comfort.  Colectivos running from Huaraz to Yungay are frequent.  To get to destinations beyond typically requires a transfer.\n\nAnother option is to arrange for a taxi.  The price will vary depending on the distance.  If you are on a tight schedule or want to travel in greater comfort, this is a reasonable, although not cheap option. \n\nBags being loaded onto an already packed colectivo\nHelping a taxi navigate a rut in the road\nServicesPorters, Cooks, and Arrieros (mule drivers), can all be arranged in Huaraz.  It is also usually possible to track down a porter or cook at the trailhead, depending on the valley you are in.  All of these trades have professional associations that provide training and also determine prices.  For a cook or porter, the fee is typically $25/day, while arrieros cost about $10/day with 5$/day for each burro.  You are expected to provide meals and shelter (if necessary).  A porter can take about 40kg, while each burro can carry 40 kg max. These individuals are usually very friendly, know the mountains well and are happy to help you.  The cooks can make things in the mountains that rival most peoples\u2019 home cooking.\n\n", "Overview": "\n            Huaraz is a city of 100,000 inhabitants that is the capitol of the Ancash Department, Peru and sits at the base of the magnificent Cordillera Blanca (Google map).

Lodgepole is roughly equidistant from San Francisco and Los Angeles, both of which have better connectivity with the world's air corridors.  Car rental is available at all of these major airports.    Travel by Private Car\r\n  Depending on which direction you approach from, there are two access routes to Lodgepole.  1) From Fresno and points north (e.g. San Francisco), the best route is State Highway 180, east from Fresno.  From Fresno, proceed approximately 60 miles (95 km) on 180 until you reach a fork in the road.  Highway 180 is the left fork, which continues into Kings Canyon National Park.  To reach Lodgepole, take the right fork, Highway 198 (Generals Highway) and follow obvious signs to Sequoia National Park.  Lodgepole is approximately 20 miles (30 km) from the fork.  2) From points south (e.g. Los Angeles), take Highway 198 west from the city of Visalia.  Simply follow 198 until you reach Lodgepole, approximately 65 miles (100 km) later.    Both highway 180 and 198 are snow-plowed during winter months.  Still, you are required by law to carry tire chains, regardless of current conditions    Public Transportation\r\n  Unfortunately, public transportation options are scant.

Both campgrounds charge a camping fee (around $10) and take reservations (recommended during the summer months).  Dorst Creek is closed in the winter months, while Lodgepole Village is open year-around.    Backcountry Camping\r\n  Generally, backcountry camping is permitted anywhere in the wilderness, i.e., more than a mile from the nearest paved road.  Wilderness permits (free, issued at Lodgepole Visitors Center), required for any overnight stay in the backcountry are issued on a quota basis, however, so you may not be able to camp in the most popular areas once the quota for those areas fills.  Along the more popular trails, special backcountry campgrounds exist.  Sometimes these campgrounds have water (important during summer in dry regions), and they almost always have secure bear storage boxes.  This can save you carrying the weight of a heavy bear-proof food container.  In regions without bear boxes, a canister may be required, depending on the area.  Canisters can be rented at wilderness permit stations.    Lodging\r\n  The new Wuksachi Village/Lodge, located roughly 2 miles toward Fresno/Highway 180 from Lodgepole, boasts excellent food and comfortable accomodations.

Follow this route all the way to Xela (see the road map in my maps album). You will pass through Chimaltenango and Tecpan. At Los Encuentros you will find a junction, take CA1 to the South. Stay on CA1 until you reach San Cristobal. Here you take Route 1 South directly into Xela. The drive will take between three to five hours depending on traffic and road conditions. You can use the map in the images below to see the route.\r\n\r\nA word of caution if you decide to drive. You should be aware that there are bandits who pose as police officers. If you suspect something is not right, like there is no police car or the people look suspicious, do not stop. Also, make sure you leave in plenty of time to reach Xela before dark. The roads in Guatemala are not safe to drive on in the evening and your chances of getting robbed increase dramatically.\r\n\r\nBus\r\n\r\nFrom Guatemala City take a taxi to the Transportes Galgo bus station on 7a. Avenida 19-44 in zone 1 (tel. 253-4869). For about Q60.00 you can purchase a one-way ticket to Quetzaltenango (Xela). The trip will take between 3.5 to 5 hours depending on weather, road conditions, traffic, and how many people the bus stops for along the way. If you check in gear, make sure you keep track of your luggage ticket. After you arrive in Xela, take a taxi to the Parke Central, about Q25.00, where you can catch a good meal and enjoy downtown Xela.\r\n\r\nFor more on buses and schedules click here", "Camping": "There are limited camping opportunities in Xela and surrounds. If you want to use your tent or sleep under the stars, your best bet is to find a spot on one of the volcanoes.

These include the somewhat pricy but with good selections Paiz, Hyper Paiz (both are now owned by Walmart) and the lesser priced with limited selections La Torre and Dispensa Familiar. There is a Dispensa Familiar in the Parke Central in Quetzaltenango. It has a very limited selection of snacks and packaged foodstuffs. If you plan to visit the village of Canton Chicua to explore Cerro Quemado, make sure you bring provisions with you or purchase them in Xela. The only thing you will find there are very small tiendas selling sodas, chips, soap, beer, and some \u201cfresh\u201d produce.

I usually stay at Hostal Don Diego (7a. Calle 15-20, tel. 7761-6497). The place has clean rooms and a sunny courtyard with a large eating area. The dorms feature single beds instead of bunks, but are a bit cramped. Private rooms are more spacious and all have comfortable beds piled with plenty of blankets for chilly nights (for a picture of a typical room, see images below). There are three shared bathrooms for the hostel, so we sometimes had to wait to use them. All were clean and had hot water. Price includes a cup of instant coffee and a hard roll in the morning. This hostel is very popular with foreign students coming to Xela to study Spanish. Costs run Q50.00 for a private room and Q40.00 for a bunk.

The beds are only box springs with no mattress or sheets. You do get some blankets and a small pillow. For a picture of a typical room, see images below. There is one shared bathroom with no water pressure and a rather sketchy shower. If you stay here, be prepared to make your own breakfast and coffee.

Rich in history, surrounded by tranquil beauty, and close to several major hiking and climbing areas, Tungsten Mine Camp is an ideal hub for potential summiters in the Pasayten Wilderness.\r\nTungsten Mine Camp, with Wolframite Mountain in background.\r\nTungsten Mine Camp was named for the tungsten ore mineral that was discovered and mined for many years in the immediate area of the camp. The camp is located on the south slopes of Wolframite Mountain. Wolframite is the official name for iron manganese tungstate, the most important type of tungsten ore mineral and the reason why tungsten is identified with a \"W\" on the Periodic Table of Elements.\r\n\r\nBetween 1898 and 1904, tungsten deposits were discovered on the slopes of Wolframite Mountain while the U.S.-Canada Boundary Line was being surveyed and slashed-out. In 1906, mining claim sites were developed and established. Herb Curtis, one of the crew members for the boundary project, realized the potential of the discovery and became part-owner of the mine that would begin operating on the south side of the mountain in 1908. This mine had many names during the years, including Wolframite Mine, Boundary Mine, and Tungsten Mine. Other smaller mines were also established in the area surrounding the mountain, as well. Ultimately, the mines established around Wolframite Mountain were the only sites to produce any substantial tungsten ore minerals (including scheelite, for which nearby Scheelite Pass was named) in the Pasayten Wilderness. In effect, the mining operations at and around Tungsten Mine Camp led to the establishment of further exploration of the Pasayten Wilderness region and the creation of routes within it.\r\nUpper (Smaller) Cabin\r\nBetween 1915 and 1918, mining operations at Tunsten Mine Camp boomed. An influx of workers and settlers entered the region. All materials used in and for the Tungsten Mine were hauled by horses, taking four days in each direction to travel. In 1915, during a winter of record snowfall at that time, an estimated $10,000 was spent to create a \u201csnow road\u201d from the nearest town (Loomis) to the Tungsten Mine at Wolframite Mountain; all grades, fills, and cuts for the road were completely built of snow. By 1916, 80 men were employed at the mine. By 1920, the mine had produced six carloads of hand-sorted wolframite and tungsten. Most of that ore was shipped to Germany as a steel hardener for the country\u2019s munitions. \r\n\r\nHowever, the ore production and operation of the mine proved too costly to maintain. The angle of the ore veins and the remoteness of the mining location greatly limited production. The mine operated periodically throughout the years, even shipping a record 30 tons of ore in 1936 (but at a financial loss). In the early 1940s, a newer 10-ton-per-day spiral concentrator was added to the mine camp. This allowed the mine to produce 300 tons of more ore, before the mine later had to cease its operations as a result of large tungsten deposits found in more-easily accessible locations in Colorado. When the Tungsten Mine first started its operations the price of tungsten was $5 per pound, but at the time the mine closed the price of tungsten had fallen to less than $1 per pound. The production value of the Tungsten Mine, had it continued it operations, would have been at a 5x loss.\r\n\r\nAfter the Tungsten Mine ceased operations, Tungsten Mine Camp and the surrounding area was mostly abandoned and ignored for many years. However, due to the popularity of hiking and climbing in the Pasayten Wilderness, Tungsten Mine Camp and its surrounding area has been increasingly gaining recognition once again. The defunct campsite, a semi-popular destination for hikers in the Pasayten Wilderness, is still located at the junction (6750\u2019 elevation) of Tungsten Creek Trail #534 and Boundary Trail #533. This is significant to many backcountry enthusiasts because the Boundary Trail is one of the major passageways of the Pacific Northwest Trail that travels from Montana to the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nToday, two large buildings remain at the mine camp, as well as some machinery, collapsed/sealed mineshafts, and brick remnants of the original mill. Old rusty remnants of the mining operations can be found throughout the vicinity of the Tungsten Mine Camp and the south side of Wolframite Mountain. The site of the Tungsten Mine operations is a short walk below the Tungsten Mine Camp, down the slope from the camp.\r\nOld Mining Remnants\r\nTungsten Mine Camp is centrally located for several large and/or important summiting opportunities in the region. Most notably are the peaks in the immediate area that are all over 8000' elevation. One such peak is Wolframite Mountain, which as mentioned earlier looms above the campsite to the north. Located south of Tunsten Mine Camp is the next-closest peak, Apex Mountain, which is the 18-tallest peak in the Pasayten Wilderness and just barely misses the official Top-100 peak list for Washington. Located only several miles west of Tungsten Mine Camp are more popular hiking/climbing destinations Cathedral Peak and Amphitheater Mountain, both of which are Top-100 peaks of Washington. Located only several miles east of Tungsten Mine Camp is Bauerman Ridge, the 23rd-most prominent peak in the Pasayten Wilderness.\r\nNearby Apex, Amphitheater, Cathedral, and Wolframite...\r\nOther notable peaks that are within a day's journey of Tungsten Mine Camp include Teapot Dome, Windy Peak, Remmel Mountain, and Armstrong Mountain, among many others. Summiting mountains within the region ranges from very easy to very difficult, depending on peaks and routes involved. This helps make Tungsten Mine Camp a preferred logistical center for many hikers, mountaineers, climbers, and summiters of all levels of expertise.\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDue to hiking distances, unpredictable weather patterns, and long winter seasons, Tungsten Mine Camp is best recommended to be attempted between late June to early September. Check with the Okanogan National Forest's Tonasket Ranger District for current trail, snow, and weather conditions at Tungsten Mine Camp.\r\n\r\nTungsten Mine Camp, and the major routes leading to the area, can be found on Green Trails Map #20.\r\n", "Object ID": "592385", "Object Title": "Tungsten Mine Camp", "Created/Edited": "Jan 27, 2010 / Feb 25, 2010", "Red Tape": "A backcountry permit (free) must be filled-out at any of the major trailheads prior to entering the area.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tungsten Mine Camp lies within a \"Fee Use\" zone.

I-80 crosses the bay with the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. Stay on 80 as it passes through Vallejo,  Fairfield, Vacaville and Davis. Once you reach Sacramento, follow the directions below.\r\n\r\nGetting to South Lake Tahoe From Sacramento: 102 Miles \u2013 About 2 Hours. \u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nTake U.S. Highway 50 east to South Lake Tahoe. This is a great drive in the summer time. During winter it is subject to closures during storms and when it clear it is clogged with traffic heading up to ski at one of the many ski areas that ring Lake Tahoe. Highway 50 make a nice gradual climb up the west side of the Sierra Nevada Range, passing the popular rock climbing areas  Phantom Spires and  Lovers Leap until it tops out at Echo Summit. You then begin a series of hairpin turns as you descend down into the Tahoe Valley. The first town you will get to is Meyers, which is just north of the junction of Highways 50 and 89. Keep driving on Highway 50/89 for about 5 miles until you 50 and 89 split again in South Lake Tahoe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn alternate route from Sacramento would be to take Interstate 80 east towards Truckee and Reno \r\nand follow the directions listed below for Truckee. Interstate 80 is a nice route head up. It travels \r\nthrough Donnor Pass to other climbing and hiking areas such as  Castle Peak and  Mount Lola.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting to South Lake Tahoe From  Reno and Carson City: 60 Miles \u2013 About 1 hour from reno and  28 Miles \u2013 About half an hours from Carson City\r\nTake U.S. Highway 50 west to Stateline and South Lake Tahoe. When you get to Glenbrook Highway 50 turns south and follows the east shore of Lake Tahoe. Shortly after passing over the State Line (this will be easy to notice because the California side lacks the casinos.), you will find yourself in South Lake Tahoe.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting to South Lake Tahoe From Truckee: 46 Miles \u2013 About 1 hour. \r\nTake Highway 89 south from Interstate 80. This is a wonderful and scenic drive that takes you past Squaw Valley and along the west shore of Lake Tahoe. Shortly after passing the Tahoe Keys, Highway 89 and Highway 50 connect in the city of South Lake Tahoe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAirports\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2022  Lake Tahoe Airport: 1901 Airport Road,  South Lake Tahoe,  California 96150, (530) 541-4082. The Lake Tahoe Airport is located in Tahoe Valley between Meyers and the city of South Lake Tahoe.

When the snow melts out there are hundreds of miles of trails for hiking and mountain biking. \r\n \r\nFor purposes of this page I set the area of South Lake Tahoe from as far north as Tahoma on the west shore and Glenbrook on the east shore.

Because of numerous ski areas, mild summers and casinos there are countless motels, hotels and cabins. They range from lowly motor lodges to casino motels to luxury resorts. This website is useful in planning a trip to the Tahoe area no matter what time of year it is. There are a lot of lodging options in the South Lake Tahoe area, too many to list.  Due to Tahoe being a year round playground. I highly recommend getting reservations any time you plan on using a motel.  The hotels listed below got high Customer Rating rankings at Orbitz.

However you will need a permit for campfires, fuel cutting, cutting Christmas trees, Sno-Park, special use, and Wilderness Use (see Desolation Wilderness. Campfire permits are required for stoves, lanterns, charcoal barbecues, or wood campfire outside of developed campgrounds. They are free of charge and are available at Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Forest Supervisor's Office or the Taylor Creek Visitor Center. For information about the other permit requirements, visit the Lake Tahoe Basin Unit site.\r\n\r\nQuotas\r\nThere are no quotas for areas outside of Wilderness boundaries. \r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Red Tape\r\n1.

But you may not take the bike up the Freel Peak Trail.\r\n3. Dogs must be on a leash at all times.\r\n\r\nFor a list of rules and regulations, visit the Lake Tahoe Basin Unit site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRed Tape for Desolation Wilderness\r\n\r\nPermits\r\nPlenty of red tape here. First off, you need a permit to enter Desolation Wilderness year round. Whether you are going in as a daytrip or an overnighter. For day trips during the summer, the permit is free and you can pick it up at the major trailheads or at one of the nearby ranger stations. For a day trip during winter the trailheads are shut down and you must pick up your permit at a ranger station. If you are planning on going into Desolation overnight you must pick up your permit at one of the ranger stations listed below and you are subject to fees. \u00a0Typical Desolation Wilderness Marker.\r\n\r\nQuotas\r\nThere is a quota for overnight users from the Friday before Memorial Day to September 30th of every year due to heavy use of Desolation Wilderness. The quota is based on the number of people entering the wilderness each day, and their first night's destination zone. 50% of the quota is based on reservation and the remainder is based on first-come, first served on the day of entry. The quota system does not pertain to day trips or off-season overnighters. \r\n\r\nMiscellaneous Red Tape\r\n1. Campfires are prohibited inside Desolation Wilderness.\r\n2.

Check in with the ranger stations for campground restrictions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "When To Climb": "Year round. I think the best time to climb and hike in the Lake Tahoe area is late July to late October. But late July (in normal years) most of the snow is melted out and Mosquitoes have cleared out for the most part. During the summer months temperatures rarely get about 80\u00b0 F or drop below 40\u00b0 F at night. By November the weather changes dramatically with high temperatures around 47\u00b0 F and lows about 22\u00b0 F. \r\n\r\nUsually the heavy snows start in November. Highways 89 and 50 generally stay opened, only closed during strong snowstorms. But a lot of the secondary roads that lead up to the trailheads close shortly after the snow starts. The exceptions to this being the roads that lead to the many ski resorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Major Trailheads": "\u00a0\r\n\r\n Desolation Wilderness Trailheads\r\n\r\n These trailheads service the west side of Desolation.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Loon Lake (6,390'): The trailhead is located on the south shore of Loon Lake near the Loon Lake Dam. To get to the trailhead take Ice House Road and follow it for 28 miles until you see a sign that says \u201dLoon Lake Forest Service Campground\u201d. Take a right here and follow the road for another 1/4 mile to the parking lot. The Loon Lake Trail heads south from the trailhead, while a trailhead north, and follows the lake shore and eventually joins with the Rubicon Trail. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Buck Island (6,180'): This trailhead is near the northern border of Desolation at Buck Island Lake. Buck Island Lake is only accessible by trail or the Rubicon OHV Trail. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Van Vleck (6,560'): This Trailhead is remote and can be hard to find. To get to the trailhead take Ice House Road and follow it for 23 miles to the Robbs Saddle area. Take a right turn and travel 5 miles east on the Tells Creek/Cheese Camp Road (Forest Road 36). Once you reach a fork in the road, take the right fork. Go 5 miles to the plowed parking area at the entrance to the campground road. Both of the trails that leave this trailhead, head into the northwestern part of the wilderness. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Rockbound (6,960'): The Rockbound Trailhead is located on the west shore of Wrights Lake. From Highway 50 drive 7 miles up the Wrights Lake Road, turn left onto Union Road \u201cF\u201d and drive that road for little over a quarter mile until you reach your trial head. There are many trails out of here, but this is the fastest way to reach Rockbound Pass in the Crystal Range.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Twin Lakes (6,960'): Like Rockbound Trailhead this trailhead is located at Wrights Lake, but this one is on the west shore. To reach this trailhead drive 7 miles up the Wrights Lake Road from Highway 50, but instead of turning left at the intersection at Wrights Lake, turn right onto Union Road \u201cJ\u201d. Follow Road J for close to a mile to the end of the road and the parking lot. From this trailhead you can either hike to the Grouse Lake Trail or hike to Twin Lakes.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Lyons Creek Trailhead\r\n\u2022 Lyons Creek (6,740') This trail head is located just off of Writes Lake Road. From Highway 50 drive for 4 miles up the narrow single lane road until you get to the trailhead, which will be on the right side of the road. This is a popular trailhead for climbing Mount Price, Mount Agassiz and Pyramid Peak. There are self-issue day permits available here. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Pyramid Creek (Twin Bridges) (6,120'): This trailhead is located just off of Highway 50, and is imposable to miss. It is located in horseshoe bend just before Highway 50 climbs up to Echo Summit. Just look for the tourons staring at the waterfall. This is a popular trailhead for climbing Pyramid Peak. There are self-issue day permits available here.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Ralston (6,520'): This trailhead is located just off of Highway 50, about 1 mile east of the Pyramid Creek (Twin Bridges) trailhead. Look for a turnoff on the north side of the road in Camp Sacramento. This is a popular trailhead for climbing Mount Ralston and hiking into Desolation Valley. \r\n\r\n These trailheads service the east side of Desolation.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Echo Lakes (7,500'): This Trailhead is located at the eastern end of Lower Echo Lake near the Echo Lake Chalet. To get there take Highway 50 to Echo Summit. From Highway 50 turn on to Johnson Pass Road. Drive on Johnson Pass Road and turn north onto Echo Lakes Road. After a little more then a half of a mile you will see a large parking area, this is where you park. The Pacific Crest Trail/Tahoe Rim Trail passes thorough here, and goes along the north shore of the two Echo Lakes into Desolation Wilderness. You can also catch a water taxi here that will cut about 2.5 miles off your trip, but it will set you back about $10.00 per person, one way. This is a popular trailhead for hiking into Desolation Valley.  Warning:, according to Google maps, Echo Lakes is known as Lily Lake. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Glen Alpine (6,540'): The Glen Alpine Trailhead is located at the southern end of Fallen Leaf Lake. To reach it, take Highway 89 north, just after passing Camp Richardson, turn left on Fallen Leaf Road. Head down Fallen Leaf Road for 4.8 miles and turn left onto Glen Alpine Road. After about 1.2 miles you will reach a small parking area close to the gate stops traffic at Lily Lake. This is a good trailhead to reach the heart of Desolation Wilderness quickly as well as a trailhead for the Glen Alpine Trail route up Mount Tallac.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Mount Tallac (6,436'): This might be the most popular trailhead for climbing Mount Tallac. The trailhead is located about 1.1 miles from Highway 89 at a large parking area at the southern end of Mount Tallac Road  \u201cA\u201d. This is a very popular trailhead, because it gives you the quickest way to the top of Mount Tallac as well as quick access to the heart of Desolation Wilderness. You can pick up a day use permit at this trailhead. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Bayview (6,860'): This trailhead is just off of Highway 89, near Inspiration Point Vista and Bayview campground.  Bayview is just outside of the wilderness boundary and is the trailhead for climbing Maggies Peaks as well as hiking into the Velma Lakes area. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Eagle Falls (6,600'): The Eagle Falls trail head is located just north of Bayview along Highway 89 at the west end of Emerald Bay. This trailhead is popular for quick access to Dick and Jacks Peaks and getting to Velma Lakes. There is a $3.00 a day charge to park here and the lot can fill up early on summer weekends. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Meeks Bay (6,230'): This is the northern most trailhead to get into Desolation. It is also the northern terminus of the Tahoe-Yosemite Trail. The trailhead is located just off Highway 89 near the Meeks Bay campground. From the trailhead it is a six-mile hike to Lake Genevieve in the Northeastern corner of the wilderness. \r\n\r\n\r\n Trailheads off Highway 50\r\n\r\n\u2022 Echo Summit (7,380'): This trailhead is located at the top of Echo\u00a0Echo Summit Summit where the Pacific Crest Trail/Tahoe Rim Trail crosses Highway 50. Look for a turn out on the south side of the road when you reach Echo Summit, there will be and easy to spot sign when heading up both ways. If you head north from here you can get to Desolation Wilderness. Hiking south will take you to Little Round Top and Carson Pass. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Fountain Place (Trout Creek) (7,800'): This trailhead allows for the quickest access for climbing Freel Peak and Job\u2019s Sister. You can either take the Trout Creek Route or take the trail to Armstrong Pass and catch the Tahoe Rim Trail. To get to the trailhead, take Highway 50/89 to Meyers. When you get to the town of Meyers look for a road called Pioneer Trail. Turn onto Pioneer Trail and look for Oneidas Street and turn right. Shortly after passing a small group of houses Oneidas Street turns into a one-lane road for the next 4.5 miles. When you see a gate blocking your way find a place to park along the road.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Kingsbury Grade South (7,520'): Kingsbury South is located 1.4 miles south of Nevada Highway 207 at the southern end of Tramway Drive. This trailhead is used for the Tahoe Rim Trail and for climbing Monument Peak. The trail section of the Tahoe Rim Trail ends here, but you can pick it up again at the Kingsbury Grade North trailhead. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Kingsbury Grade North (7,780'): This trailhead is about 1.8 miles north of Highway 207 on Castle Rock Road. To reach the trailhead, take North Benjamin Drive north form the 207. Stay on this road, but beware that the road changes its name from North Benjamin Dr to Andria Dr to Castle Rock Road along the way. The trail section of the Tahoe Rim Trail ends here, but you can pick it up again at the Kingsbury Grade South trailhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n Trailheads off Highway 89\r\n\r\n\u2022 Hawley Grade (6,400'): This minor trailhead is located at the southern end of Hawley Grade Road, near Luther Pass. To reach it, turn west onto South Upper Truckee Road. After 1.1 miles turn left onto Hawley Grade. The Trailhead is .3 mile at the end of the road. The only trail here is the Hawley Grade Trail, which heads up to Echo Summit. If you are feeling adventurous you could follow the Truckee River cross-country to Little Round Top.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Bridge Road (6,400'): Like the close by Hawley Grade Trail head this is another minor trailhead. To reach it, turn east onto South Upper Truckee Road. After .9 miles turn left onto Bridge Road. The Trailhead is .3 mile at the end of the road. The only trail that leaves heads southbound and links up with the Tahoe Rim Trail near Round Lake. \r\n\r\n\u2022 Big Meadow (7,300'): This trailhead is located along Highway 89 at the eastern terminus of Upper Truckee Road,  about 3.3 miles west of Luther Pass or 5.2 miles south of the Highways 50/89 junction  at Meyers.  This trailhead is used mostly for Tahoe Rim Trail users, because the TRT crosses 89 here. Or you can use this trail head to climb up the west ridge of  Waterhouse Peak.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Grass Lake (7,715'): This trailhead is used mostly for the Tahoe Rim Trail. It is located along Highway 89, about 1.8 miles west of Luther Pass or 6.7 miles south of the Highways 50/89 junction at Meyers. Like Big Meadow, this trailhead can be used for climbing Waterhouse Peak, this time by the north face. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=38.91401&amp;distance_lon_10=-120.00435&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">38.91401\u00b0N / 120.00435\u00b0W</a>", "Further Information": "Books \r\n \r\n\u2022  California County Summits \r\n \r\nExternal Links \r\n\r\nNational Forest\r\n\r\n\u2022 El Dorado National Forest\r\n\u2022 Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit\r\n\u2022 Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest\r\n\r\n\r\nState Parks\r\n\r\n\u2022  Emerald Bay \r\n\u2022   D.L.

On\r\nthe eastern side, the YARTS line terminates at Mammoth Lakes, which has a Greyhound stop.

The Tuolumne Meadows logistic center is the staging ground for a  myriad summer activities.  In the parking lot of the Tuolumne Meadows grocery store, you'll see 75-year-old retirees stepping out of their pricey \"Hotels-On-Wheels\", grizzled rock climbers guzzling stouty hops, and San Francisco backcountry bums posing out in the latest tech gear.\r\n\r\nThe namesake, Tuolumne Meadows, is a broad, unusually flat meadow, in the guts of Yosemite's central backcountry.  Multiple tributary streams, from the countless high peaks of the Sierra Crest and Cathedral Range, converge to meet the Tuolumne River, before it rapidly drops into a deep gorge, the \"Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne\".\r\n\r\nServices here are quite spartan.  Open only during the summer (like Tioga Road itself), this logistical center has a gas station, a tiny market, a small visitors center, campgrounds, a small lodge, and a short-order grill.  Historically, this area is trapped between two diametrically-opposed visions of the national park mission.  The Tioga Road was enthusiastically widened in the early 1950's, making the whole region more accessible to tourists.  However, by the 1960's, before the infrastructure could be built up to the point of Yosemite Valley, attitudes in the Park Service changed to a more preservationalist bent, so there simply isn't much going on in Tuolumne Meadows for the vested \"tour-on\". For the aspiring ascensionist, vast climbing potential overwhelms the budding adventurist!.\r\n", "Page Type": "Logistical Center", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=10&amp;distance_10=100&amp;distance_lat_10=37.87720&amp;distance_lon_10=-119.37670&amp;map_10=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.87720\u00b0N / 119.3767\u00b0W</a>", "Notable Interests": "Haven't got any plans for grubbing other than the lame menu you brought up to the Meadows? Then make your way down Tioga Road to the Whoa Nellie Deli (aka The Tioga Mobile Gas  Station). Located at  the intersection of I-395 and Hwy 120, WND offers a fine spread of ecclectic California eats. A Mobile Station, you say? Come experience this original place first hand. Sure, half of the place is a Mobile gas station but it's the one Mobile staion you can get the world's finest Fish Taco's, garnished with a mango chutney. The menu is genuinely fresh and so are the cooks! Most of the employees are Valley or Meadows transplants/transients who offer their own unique blend of character to the place. The ambience can't be beat: climbers chatting about the days' exploits, heated/shaded dining patio, a great wine selection, and a splendid view of Mono Lake and the upper Owen's Valley.\r\n\r\nNot enough entertainment to drag your carcass out of that 35' foot RV (complete with 116-channel satelite dish!)? The Deli also provides musical entertainment from time to time. While your stuffing your face with Wild Buffulo Meatloaf, the Tungsten City Band will definately complete your WND experience. This is a band that is climbing (literally) in popularity on the Sierra east side. The band has regularly lit up the place on Firday nights, playing everything from ska, funk, reggae, driving folk rock, and even bluegrass. The trio: Chris Canales, Austin Archer, and \"Milo\" Lance Cagle, have transformed the gateway to Yosemite into a mini-concert site. Be sure to catch their concert schedule at the Deli.\r\n\r\n      \r\n", "Camping/Accomodations": "Car/RV Camping\r\n\r\nThere is a campground for tents and RV's at Tuolumne Meadows which costs $20/night.

Wilderness permits, required for any overnight stay in the backcountry are issued on a quota basis, however, so you may not be able to camp in the most popular areas once the quota for those areas fills.  The most convenient permit office is approximately 1 mile east of Tuolumne Meadows, and well-marked (\"Wilderness Permits\") from the highway.  Unlike Sequoia/Kings Canyon NP, bear-proof food canisters are not required, though they are strongly recommended.  Canisters can be rented at wilderness permit stations.\r\n\r\nLodging\r\n\r\n\"Tuolumne Meadows Lodge is open from approximately early June to mid-September and is located on the Tioga Pass Road, near the park's eastern entrance on Highway 120 East...Tuolumne Meadows Lodge has 69 canvas cabin accommodations.\"   White Wolf Lodge, approximately 15 miles east of Tuolumne Meadows on Highway 120, has available \"24 canvas cabins and four cabins with private bath.\"\r\n\r\nThe most convenient outside-the-park lodging is in the town of Lee Vining, about 20 miles east of Tuolumne Meadows.\r\n\r\nHigh Sierra Camps\r\n\r\nYosemite Concessions Service operates these full-service (food,tent,hot showers provided) camps as a pricy alternative to backpacking. \"The five High Sierra Camps are spaced 5.7 to 10 miles apart along a loop trail in Yosemite's beautiful high country...\r\n\r\nHigh Camps\r\n\r\nGlen Aulin - 8 cabins, total occupancy 32.\r\n\r\nMay Lake - 8 cabins, total occupancy 36.\r\n\r\nSunrise Camp - 9 cabins, total occupancy 34.\r\n\r\nMerced Lake - 19 cabins, total occupancy 60.\r\n\r\nVogelsang - 12 cabins, total occupancy 42.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inyo National Forest offers paid campsites just outside the park boundries (Tioga Entrance) at Saddlebag Lake and other various campgrounds right along Tioga Road.

A Golden Eagle pass allows entry to all national parks and many federal recreation areas.  These passes cost $80 and are good for one year from the date of purchase.\r\n\r\nBlack bear restrictions:  If you drive a private car into the park, you must adhere to strict regulations on the storage of food, because black bears in the park have grown accustomed to \"liberating\" stored food from vehicles, at any time of the day or night.  If a bear breaks into your car to steal food (even candy-bar wrappers constitute \"food\"), you are liable for $500 or more in fines.\r\n\r\nOvernight road closure:  Although the official Tioga Road winter closure (between Crane Flat and Tioga Pass) is in effect only between mid-November and late-May, the park service prohibits overnight parking anywhere on Tioga Road after October 15.  The area is open to dayhiking until the official road closure, but I guess the park service fears that a storm can unexpectedly close the road at any time, and leave you and your car stranded!  \r\n\r\nIf you plan on crossing Tioga Road in late fall (before it closes) or in late spring (after it opens), carry tire chains in your vehicle.\r\n", "Created/Edited": "Feb 2, 2002 / Jul 17, 2011", "Location": "California, United States, North America"}
