{"GETTING THERE": "\u00a0East Fork Trail near Art Nord\r\nFrom I-15 on the north side of Ogden, take the 12th street exit (#347) and head east.  The road will continue into Ogden Canyon (12th Street turns into Highway 39).  At the mouth of the Canyon as you begin on the windy road, you\u2019ll see a waterfall that almost always has kids, tourists and random cars.  Don\u2019t be distracted as the pretty waterfall is actually runoff from the city\u2019s aqueduct.  Continue east on Highway 39 through the canyon.  As the road exits the canyon, you\u2019ll pass Wheeler Canyon Trailhead on the right and Pineview reservoir will be on the left. Follow Highway 49 keeping an eye out for the Old Snowbasin Road sign\u2014it\u2019s a small sign.  Take a right onto Highway 226 (Old Snowbasin Road) for about 3.5 miles.  Art Nord Drive Trailhead is on the right. ", "OVERVIEW": "\n            \u00a0Hiking Trail Near Art Nord\r\n\r\nArt Nord Trailhead, located at 41.233514,-111.820763 is a crossroads link to Maples (Snowbasin) Trailhead, Wheeler Canyon (Pineview) Trailhead, and East Fork (Green Pond) Trail. The Old Snowbasin Road also runs directly past it.   Art Nord, as a connection to the Great Western Trail, links the Maples section to the Wheeler Canyon section. \r\n\r\nThe trailhead, in and of itself, is of more interest to mountain bikers than people attempting any of the area\u2019s mountains on foot.  The nearest summits are Sardine Peak and Mount Ogden ; both are 3+ miles to the south.  A much closer jumping off point for either peak is the Snowbasin Resort.  Mountain bikers, however, move much faster than hikers and the trails in the area are scenic, non-technical routes.  Some bikers use Art Nord as a starting point for a 10-20 mile mountain loop in the area. Various routes will take a biker past Sardine Peak, the Ogden Overlook , Mt. Ogden, Green Pond, Strawberry Peak and/or any combination thereof.  Previously, the Snowbasin Resort even offered Art Nord to Snowbasin shuttle service\u2026check their website for availability. Mountain bikers can also go north from Art Nord through Icebox Canyon or down to Pineview Reservoir through Wheeler Canyon (about 3 miles on an old gravel road) to Wheeler Trailhead.  \r\n\r\n\u00a0Old Snowbasin Road right next to trail head...start your Nordic Ski here!\r\n\r\nIn winter, Art Nord gets high use from Nordic Skiers.  The same trails mountain bikers use in the summer are good for cross-country skiing in winter too.  Like everywhere else in Utah, there is usually plenty of virgin snow come late-December.  The Green Pond Trail heading north east from Art Nord is a reasonably gentle grade but ungroomed.  The Old Snowbasin Road immediately adjacent to Art Nord Trailhead is closed to traffic and groomed all the way up to Snowbasin resort. This 3 mile road ski is a hard trip up and a nice glide back to the trailhead with 780 feet of elevation gain/loss.  The Snowbasin Road route  links into several other Nordic trails near Snowbasin Resort for a total of 15 miles of groomed trails.  There is no charge for Nordic skiing in the area. \r\n\r\nThe area is great for general hiking and snowshoeing (3-5 mile hikes without crazy/steep trails). It\u2019s perfect for getting the little guys out on nature walks and/or romping through the snow.  The Icebox Canyon loop is just a couple of miles long but features some pretty hiking/snowshoe scenery. \r\n\r\nArt Nord trailhead was named, you guessed it, after Art Nord who was a Forest Service employee in the mid-1900s. He was instrumental in making the Snowbasin/Forest Service deal that saved the area\u2019s watershed and rehabilitated the local landscape.  A monument with background history is just north of the trailhead. \r\n", "Page Type": "Trailhead", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/fleshj27/63611\">Fleshj27</a>", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=13&amp;distance_13=100&amp;distance_lat_13=41.23351&amp;distance_lon_13=-111.82076&amp;map_13=1&amp;is_open=1\">41.23351\u00b0N / 111.82076\u00b0W</a>", "Location": "Utah, United States, North America", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "TRAILHEAD INFO": "The trailhead has a large parking lot with around a 10-car capacity.

{"Overview:  Hiking and Canyoneering": "\n            This trailhead (elevation 1,100 ft.) provides access to Bailey Canyon, a relatively short, but deep, narrow and rugged canyon that scours a path about a mile into the San Gabriel foothills above Sierra Madre, California.  In the 1880\u2019s, the canyon was a mecca for the commercial trapping of foxes and coyotes.  Today, the canyon\u2019s uses are strictly recreational.  However, the coyotes are still there and are apt to be seen in the early evenings near the bottom of the canyon.  \r\n\r\nThe trailhead affords direct access to Jones Peak, Hastings Peak, Mt.

The (main) Bailey Canyon Trail continues up the east slope of the canyon 2.8 more miles to the saddle north of Jones Peak.  From the saddle, a firebreak along a ridge going northwest connects to the Mt. Wilson Toll Road 5 miles from the trailhead, and one can continue up to Mt. Wilson along the toll road.  \r\n\r\n\u00a0In foreground is the ridge that curves northwest from Jones saddle and connects with the Mt.

The lower portion just out of the trail head has been re-routed where they built the tanks and there are several new trails that have been built for mountain bikes and/or hiking.   \n\nThe Trailhead accesses three area trails:\n\nFoothill Loop: Jogger/mountain bike trail along the golf course\nStrong\u2019s Canyon: A \u00bd mile trail through the forest and up the canyon; links to Bonneville Shoreline Trail\nBonneville Shoreline Trail:  A 90-mile trail running along the Wasatch Front west face\n\nYou can reach several interesting objectives from the 36th Street Trailhead including Waterfall, Taylor, and Beus Canyons.   \n\nWaterfall Canyon: Hike up Strong Canyon trail to its end ~1/2 mile. There is a small footbridge and a sign.  Go North (left...not across the bridge) on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail for ~1.2 miles.  \n\nTaylor Canyon: Hike up Strong Canyon trail to its end ~1/2 mile. There is a small footbridge and a sign.  Go North (left...not across the bridge) on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail for ~1.2 miles. Cross the small foot bridge next to Waterfall Canyon Trail and continue on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail for another mile. \n\nBeus Canyon: Hike up Strong Canyon trail to its end ~1/2 mile. There is a small footbridge and a sign.  Go South across the bridge (Right) on the Bonneville Shoreline Trail for ~1.2 miles. \n\nThe Strong Canyon area is a popular area for evening hiking and mountain biking.  During the winter/late fall the trails are beaten down but the Strong Canyon trail does get a fair amount of ice\u2014Yak Tracks/traction devices are recommended.  During the summer, the area is crowded with dog-walkers, hiker groups and mountain bikers which makes it harder to enjoy.  \n\nThere aren\u2019t any formal camping sites in the general area, although once up the canyons there are a couple of spots for primitive camping.  During the summer, fires are prohibited on the west faces of the hills due to the forest fire threat.  The area still gets a big brush fire every couple of years, so be careful.

It can serve as a launchpoint for attempting Mt. Ogden from the west via either Waterfall Canyon or Malan Peak.   The trailhead is located conveniently in Ogden and is well maintained. It closes after sunset and opens a half hour before sunrise.  \r\n\r\nFrom the trailhead parking lot, the trail immediately diverges either up the hill or south.  The south branch is the 36th Street exercise trail which is popular with mountain bikers and joggers. This trail will take you past the golf course and to Strong\u2019s Canyon.  If you head up the hill (East), you will reach the Bonneville Shoreline Trail (BST) in about .75 miles.  If you go South on the BST, you will reach Strong Canyon in about 1.2 miles and can go onto Beus Canyon another 2 miles on the trail.  If you go North on the BST, you will reach Taylor Canyon in about 1.5 miles and can go up Malan Peak from there.  If you continue East up the canyon from this point, that is Waterfall Canyon and will reach the waterfall in about .75 miles.  True professionals can continue by climbing the iffy trail next to the waterfall and press on toward Mt. Ogden.  Finally,  there is a small clearing next to the bridge at the cross road.  If you look carefully at the rocks next to clearing there is a privately owned Via Ferrata route up the side of the mountain (See their Website www.facebook.com/MountOgdenViaFerrata).\r\n\r\nThe area is very popular for hiking and mountain biking. During the Winter and Fall, there aren\u2019t very many people but during the summer the entire area is awash with mountain bikers and hikers.

Start down the wide, well-groomed trail, and as you near the viewing area you'll hear crashing water echoing through the tall trees. Once you see it, the falling white water is awe-inspiring. The waterfall leaps into view as you round the last bend of the trail and immediately grabs your attention. The sight of the falls, the sound of the crashing water, and the mute vibrations caused by the pounding water dominate your senses. It is a wonderful experience. From the view point the trail continues on towards another viewing area and further down the trail you will reach Cave Falls.\r\n\r\n  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      Cave Falls\r\nCave Falls:\r\nCave Falls is perhaps one of the most disappointing waterfalls in the whole state, but not for the reasons you\u2019d expect. Cave Falls is also probably one of the most unique waterfalls in the whole state. Big Creek carves an impressive canyon as it makes its final descent from the volcanic plateau to the southwest of Mount Adams. Within this canyon are two notable waterfalls, Big Creek Falls, the more well known, and Cave Falls, the taller and more unique (by a long shot). Cave Falls occurs where the canyon constricts to just yards wide, and drops down one of the only true Slot Canyons in Washington. About 2/3 of the way down the canyon, the creek enters a natural cave, resulting in the name of the falls. As the creek emerges, it plunges about 40 feet into a large undercut grotto, then accelerates down the final portion of Cave Falls, which is, unfortunately the only part readily visible, hence the disappointment factor. In all, the falls are estimated to drop at least 450 feet, with a final plunge of maybe 150 feet or more. Only the top 100 feet of the final plunge can be seen. Walking along the trail, the falls are clearly audible, and fleeting glimpses can be had through the trees of portions of the falls, but short of donning a wet suit, and rappelling down the canyon itself, there is no way of seeing the entire falls.  The path continues from here along the ridge until you reach the end of the trail.  From here you can see Hemlock falls across the canyon to the left.  Views from here are spectacular.  \r\n\r\n  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      Hemlock Falls\r\nHemlock Falls:\r\nWhile Big Creek Canyon and its series of impressive waterfalls are clearly the water features of note seen in the immediate area, those who venture to the canyon-rim viewpoint overlooking the lower Lewis River Canyon will be treated to another sizable, albeit overlooked waterfall. Hemlock Creek, small enough that it isn\u2019t even mapped, but large enough that the Forest Service has named it, jumps out of the thick woods, and plunges over 200 feet down the rim of the canyon. The small watershed limits the impressiveness of the falls, which usually run dry or near to dry late in the summer, but a week or two of constant precipitation will bring it back to life in spectacular fashion. \r\n\r\n  \n                      \n                      \n                      \n                      ", "Location": "Washington, United States, North America", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/tyc/69948\">TyC</a>", "Directions": "Located near Eagle Cliff, along FR 90.

The Park site also includes maps of the area and directions  to the park.\r\n\r\nThere are two crossings, one in particular, within the Park, that can challenge avid 4-wheelers during heavy run off years. Proceed with caution and rely on your experience. These crossings will often have water rushing over the hood of your vehicle. Stalling in the crossings could be catastrophic for you and your vehicles interior and your vehicle's engine.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you arrive at the trailhead from the east and afterwards proceed west to the Park, reach the sand, lower your tire pressure and then air back up at the air station in the Park.\r\n", "Page Type": "Trailhead", "Created/Edited": "Mar 13, 2006 / Mar 13, 2006", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=13&amp;distance_13=100&amp;distance_lat_13=37.85280&amp;distance_lon_13=-105.43860&amp;map_13=1&amp;is_open=1\">37.85280\u00b0N / 105.4386\u00b0W</a>", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/csmcgranahan/19520\">csmcgranahan</a>", "Object ID": "180573", "Object Title": "Medano Lake Trailhead", "Location": "Colorado, United States, North America"},

{"Itineraries": "\nThere are several easily recognizable hiking trails starting from the trailhead 'Povera Mosca'. The easiest of those trails, and the most frequented, if you will, is a very nice round trip to the Pantagnoli fountain. This trail is well signposted and does not require any equipment, nor a refined sense of direction or special physical endurance. Terrain, length and the difference in altitude to be negotiated are moderate. It is really recommendable to everybody, so you may also bring your kids or your dog.\nFor the most part the path follows the stream-bed of the torrent Argentino and crosses the stream (solid wooden bridges) on several occasions. A few hundred meters after reaching the fountain Patagnoli (400m / 1,312ft) the main trail sharply turns left and starts ascending towards the col\u00a0Valico Castel S. Noceto (610m / 2,001ft) before dipping down again towards the forests of the valley of the Milari torrent.\n\nVegetation, Valle dell'Argentino\nSmall cataract in proximity to 'Golfo della Serra'\nAfter passing the fountain, instead of following the indications for 'Povera Mosca', another hiking trail leads up to the location 'Golfo della Serra'. From this point on (a cataract on the left side of the trail) the surroundings are getting even wilder and signposting is increasingly becoming harder to spot. The actual trail will rather have to be intuited, and the use of a proper map is highly recommended.\n(N.B.: There is no signal for cell phones, and even GPS devices are not guaranteed to be working accurately in this environment!)\n\nArgentino torrent\n\nCanyoning alternative: In order to access the splendid waterfalls and limpid pools of the upper Argentino, at 'Golfo della Serra' you will have to leave the path altogether and follow the torrent upstream. This means frequently climbing the slippery boulders and - needless to say - getting wet. Basic equipment (helmet, a short rope, harness) and\u00a0appropriate shoe-ware are recommended and can become necessary, especially for the way back.\n\nValle dell'Argentino (from Valico Castel S. Noceto)\n\nAnother nice hiking trail starts directly behind the mountain hut. It is (occasionally) signposted with the usual red/white and the number '3', to be found on larger rocks or trees. This trail leads up to the cliffs of Castello Brancato. Although being easily recognizable and not very long, the trail has some steeper parts and includes a notable difference in altitude. After crossing the wooden bridge over the Milari torrent keep on the broader main path and ignore smaller trails which are descending towards the valley.\u00a0\nAt a junction you will find only indications for Fonte Pantagnoli (to the right) and Mosca Povera. Keep always direction (straight on) and follow the path as it descends towards a ford. After the ford the path starts to rise again and, while zigzagging uphill, is almost constantly becoming steeper. Although signposting is rare, orientation should be no major issue. Reached the col, the forest will open and allow great views over the Milari and Brancato valley. Turn left for the narrow ridge that leads up to the cliff of Castello Brancato, or right for a (closed) mountain hut. Only a few meters from the hut you will find a\u00a0copious well. The 360\u00b0 view from the top is really rewarding.\n\nCastello Brancato (from the ridge)\nYet another hiking trail, for Monte Palanuda,\u00a0can be found in the vicinity of the well. For other destinations, additional information about the trails etc. you may also consult the always helpful owner of the mountain hut 'Rifugio Montano'.\n\nMap with some itineraries\n\nItinerararies from 'Povera Mosca' (IGM map - scale 1:25,000)\n1 - dark red - itinerary for Castel Brancato2 - dark green - itinerary for\u00a0Fonte Pantagnoli and Golfo do Serra3 - orange - itinerary for Timpone Garrola (1,242m) and Timpone Camagna (1,325m)\n", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Page Type": "Trailhead", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=13&amp;distance_13=100&amp;distance_lat_13=39.79046&amp;distance_lon_13=15.93861&amp;map_13=1&amp;is_open=1\">39.79046\u00b0N / 15.93861\u00b0E</a>", "How to get there": "By car the trailhead can be reached only from the small Calabrian village Orsomarso. A 6 km long dirt track follows the course of the torrent Agrigento from the village up to the actual traihead. The dirt track itself is mostly in good conditions and crosses some narrow bridges. In spring (melting of the snow) and after heavy rainfalls the torrent can swell considerably, causing the road to become\u00a0impassable.\u00a0\n\nThe village Orsomarso\nThe village Orsomarso is accessible both from the north (Mormanno) and the south (Scalea). The coastal town of Scalea is perhaps the better choice for anyone arriving from Naples. Simply take the motorway A3 (Salerno - Reggio Calabria) and exit at 'Lagonegro Nord'. Take the state roads SS585, SS18 and SS504 for Scalea, and later for Orsomarso.\u00a0\nThe alternative route passes the beautiful high plains of Campotenese. Instead of leaving the motorway at Lagonegro, exit at Mormanno and follow indications for this village. After passing the entire village, take the first road to your right. This country road is quite narrow but in good conditions. It offers great views over the Pollino massif (north) and the Pellegrino massif (south-east).\u00a0\nAlthough Scalea can also be reached by train from Naples, public transport is rather limited and the availability of bus connections etc. should\u00a0be checked beforehand. In order to reach the trailhead by foot, from the village of Orsomarso, it is a 6 km hike through the lower Argentino valley.\n", "Location": "Calabria, Italy, Europe", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/falk/114303\">Falk</a>", "Povera Mosca": " (engl.: poor fly) is one of the few trailheads which are located on the western periphery of the Orsormarso mountains (also know as the Pellegrino massif), a very little known mountain range in Southern Italy, in the region Calabria. Like the Pollino massif, also the entire Orsomarso mountain range is an integral part of the Pollino National Park. From a geological perspective it is the southernmost extension of the Apennines.\u00a0\nThe valley of the torrent Argentino, in which this trailhead can be found, is classified\u00a0Strict nature reserve or wilderness area (IUCN category\u00a0Ia or Ib). With its countless rivulets, torrents, wellsprings etc., this area is possibly the most\u00a0water-rich stretch in all South Italy. It is one of the few\u00a0untouched wilderness areas and one of the remotest and less frequented spots of the peninsula, too. Both its wildlife and vegetation are exceptional\u00a0species-rich.\n\nTrailhead 'Povera Mosca' (Orsomarso)\n\nThe Argentino torrent and its tributary valleys\u00a0invite to different activities: hiking, climbing, canyoning. Hiking trails lead up the water course, to the panoramic cliffs of\u00a0Castel Brancato (922m / 3,024ft) or as far as Timpona Camagna (1,335m / 4,379ft) or Monte Palanuda (1,632m / 5,354ft). The lush vegetation of the valley floor and the\u00a0speciose\u00a0forest open every now and again, thus allowing glimpses at steeply pitched rock faces, some of them several 100 meters high. From the cliffs and ridges the view goes over the the higher peaks of the Orsomarso range and the Tyrrhenian Sea.\u00a0\nAccommodation\nAt the small village of Orsomarso itself there are no hostels, lodging houses or similar to be found. But there are several farm houses (ital.: Agriturismo) in the area which do offer board and lodging; most of them at a reasonable price. A wider range of accommodation options (B & B, hotels, camping grounds) is available at the coastal town Scalea (Tyrrhenian Sea), only a few kilometres from Orsomarso.\nThe best choice, however, is a stay at the mountain hut 'Rifugio Montano', situated right at the green heart of the valley, at the end of the dirt track and only meters from the trailhead. The place is open all year round and offers local cuisine, a number of simple but clean and spacious rooms and, upon consultation, an area for campers and tents.

But despite all the thousands of tourists who ride the tour buses through the valley each year to take in these sights, few of them ever head west into the heart of the even more spectacular Ansel Adams Wilderness.\r\n\r\nTheir loss is your gain.  Just a few miles away from the crowds is some of the most awe-inspiring scenery to be found in the wilderness.  The trailhead leads to the Pacific Crest Trail, as well as the southern approach to Cecile Lake.  A number of worthwhile peaks can be accessed from here, including the Minarets, Iron Mountain, and the peaks of the Silver Divide.\r\n\r\nThere is developed camping near the trailhead; see the links below for details.

The stream has water in it most of the year.  Here, you can pitch a tent only a few miles from the busy metropolis below.  From the campground, the 50 foot Millard Canyon Falls are only a half mile away (east) along a trail that follows the creek upstream.

This is a popular mountain-biking, as well as hiking, trail.  A little over a mile from the start of the fireroad, the El Prieto Canyon Trail comes up on your left from its 2-mile ascent from the lower Arroyo Seco Canyon. Continuing on the fire road, in just under 3 miles, you come to a large saddle.  Here, you have the option of continuing on the Brown Mountain Fire Road or taking another fire road that descends southwest for 2.6 miles into the lower Arroyo Seco Canyon.\n\nIf you continue from the large saddle on the Brown Mountain Fire Road, the fire road tops out after 3 more miles.  At this point, you are 6 miles from the trailhead.  Here, you can pick up the steep east ridge of Brown Mountain and follow it about 2 miles with 1600 feet of gain to the summit (4,466 ft.).  Alternatively, you can hop onto the Ken Burton Trail (a wooden sign marks the start) which trail takes you on a 3 mile descent into Arroyo Seco Creek.

Only 3 miles round-trip (you will have to backtrack, this is not a loop trail) and about 300 feet elevation gain.

However, during winter months when it snows, you may need chains to get to this trailhead whose elevation is 5,110 feet.", "Overview": "\n            Eaton Saddle is a much-used trailhead in the front range of the San Gabriel Mountains.  Just past the big white gate, you start hiking west along the dirt Mt. Lowe Fire Road, crossing under the massive south face of San Gabriel Peak (6,161 ft.) and reaching Markham Saddle in about \u00bd mile.  From here, you can pick up a trail on the right to get to Mt. Disappointment (5,960 ft) and San Gabriel Peak, or take a trail on the left to climb Mt. Markham (5,742 ft.) and Mt. Lowe (5,603 ft.).  \r\n\r\nThe photos below are of, respectively, the trailhead gate; the Mueller Tunnel which bores through the south face of San Gabriel Peak; and a view down a deep canyon in the direction of Eaton Canyon.  These views are all along the Mt. Lowe Fire Road before reaching Markham Saddle.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIf you continue on the Mt. Lowe Fire Road past Markham Saddle, you will encounter a trail going east that takes you to a major trail junction, Tom Sloan Saddle.  From Sloan Saddle, you can elect (1) to drop onto a trail taking you northwest into beautiful Bear Canyon; (2) take the east ridge of Brown Mountain (adjacent to the saddle) to its summit; or (3) take yet another trail dropping south into the Arroyo Seco Creek and to the remnants of an abandoned gold mine in Millard Canyon, Dawn Mine.  There are other trail options past Markham Saddle including some that will take you south toward Eaton Canyon.\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Lowe Fire Road itself winds for miles first southerly and then westerly ending at the Sunset Ridge Trailhead above Altadena.\r\n\r\nOne final alternative from Eaton Saddle is to cross Mt. Wilson Road going away from the Mt. Lowe Fire Road and take a trail that drops northeasterly to Valley Forge, at which point you will find yet another network of trails.\r\n", "Page Type": "Trailhead", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/augie-medina/30306\">Augie Medina</a>", "Created/Edited": "Sep 18, 2006 / Nov 6, 2006", "Location": "California, United States, North America", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Object ID": "227096", "Driving Directions": "From the 210 Freeway, exit at Angeles Crest Hwy (SR 2) and go north.

The beautiful Mt. Wilson Trail winds steeply up the west side of the canyon crossing over the head of the canyon before reaching the 5,715 foot summit of Mt. Wilson, 7 miles from its start.\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Wilson Trail has a lengthy history.  Hundreds of years ago, it was a trail used by the Gabrielino Indians to access the San Gabriel Mountains and even beyond into the Mojave Desert.  At one idyllic glen near the canyon bottom, now known as Orchard Camp, an acorn sprouted about 500 years ago right above the creek bed giving life to what is seen today as a giant oak.  For the hiker, Orchard Camp is a verdant and shady rest spot on the way to Mt. Wilson.\r\n\r\nJust a mile from the trailhead, the hiker encounters jaw-dropping views of the canyon scouring deep into the mountain.  Looking over the trail\u2019s edge to hundreds of feet of precipice below, it is hard to believe that you are not even at 2,000 feet elevation at this point.  Most times of the year, you can hear and see some of the many waterfalls that tumble down the canyon bottom.\r\n\r\n\u00a0Mt. Harvard from along Mt. Wilson Trail\r\n\r\nAt 1.5 miles, you will reach First Water Junction.  Going right will take down into the creek.  The main trail continues to the left.  \r\n\r\nAt 2.5 miles, you reach the turn-off for a connector trail that takes you to the ridge north of Jones Peak.  The turn-off is intermittently marked by a small wooden sign.  If you elect this option, go left off the trail into a streambed and you will find the connector about 100 yards up the streambed. \u00a0Jones Peak (3375')west of the Mt. Wilson Trail\r\nContinuing on the Mt. Wilson trail, at about 3.2 miles, you will reach Orchard Camp.  At about 5 miles you will reach the Manzanita Ridge where there is a junction with the Winter Creek Trail coming from Chantry Flat.  \r\n\u00a0Winter Creek near Chantry Flat\r\n\r\nGoing left, the trail turns connects with the Mt. Wilson Toll Road in \u00bd mile.  Follow the toll road north another \u00bd mile until it connects again with the Mt. Wilson Trail on the right.  Follow the trail .7 miles to the summit of Mt. Wilson.  Alternatively, you can continue on the toll road all the way to the summit area ending up further west than by going up the trail.\u00a0Mt.

Disappointment Fire Road is frequently used by mountain bikers, while the San Gabriel Peak Trail is the better route for hikers.\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Disappointment Fire Road takes a circuitous route west and then south from the trailhead to the saddle (elevation 5,800 ft.) between Mt. Disappointment and San Gabriel Peak .  On the other hand, the San Gabriel Peak Trail ascends more directly first west and then south.  The San Gabriel Peak Trail tops out onto the Mt. Disappointment Fire Road just before the saddle.  At this point, you have come 2.6 miles if you came via the fire road or 1.3 miles if you came on the trail.  From this intersection point, it is about .2 miles on the fire road to the saddle.  When you reach the saddle, turn right (northwest) to ascend the rest of the paved fire road (about .2 miles) to the summit of Mt. Disappointment (5,960 ft.) or go left (southeast) to reach the trail that ascends to the summit (about .5 miles) of San Gabriel Peak (6,161 ft.).\r\n\r\nOnce you reach the saddle, you can also go southeast and access a trail that will take you in .7 miles to the Mt. Lowe Fire Road.  Numerous other trails are accessible from the Mt. Lowe Fire Road going in all directions to peaks and campsites in the San Gabriel front range.\r\n\r\nSan Gabriel Peak (6,161') seen from the Mt.

This, combined with lush and varied vegetation and flowers, make this area one of my favorite sections of the Park for an enjoyable hike. There are numerous loops and shuttles that can be combined with the Bear Lake, Cub Lake, and Hallowell Park trail systems. In September and October this region is setting for the elk rut, as majestic a wildlife spectacle as you can hope to see.\r\n\r\nGiven its relatively low elevation and distance from the peaks this is not a usual trailhead for a climb, but at least one remote peak on SP uses this trailhead as the best access!", "Page Type": "Trailhead", "Lat/Lon": "<a rel=\"noindex\" style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/object_list.php?object_type=13&amp;distance_13=100&amp;distance_lat_13=40.35490&amp;distance_lon_13=-105.63120&amp;map_13=1&amp;is_open=1\">40.35490\u00b0N / 105.6312\u00b0W</a>", "Location": "Colorado, United States, North America", "Page By": "<a style=\"color #249;\" href=\"/users/nelson/442\">Nelson</a>", "Object ID": "176918", "Object Title": "Fern Lake", "Season": "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter", "Created/Edited": "Feb 28, 2006 / Nov 15, 2009", "Driving Directions": "The road to Fern Lake is accessed from the Bear Lake road, which starts at the Beaver Meadows Entrance of RMNP.

Ogden\u00a0(9570), Allen (9465), Sardine Peak (7485), DeMoisy (9370), and/or Strawberry (9265) peaks from the east. Despite being a commercial resort, for the purposes of hiking/climbing, Snow Basin is ran more like a partnership with the USFS. The owners seem to go out of their way to accommodate hiking/climbing and seem to encourage people to use their resort for activities other than skiing. Snow Basin\u00a0resort is one of the oldest continually operated ski resorts in the US. It first opened in 1939 and was an intergal part of the USFS restoring the Wheeler Creek Watershed. Prior to the 1930s, the area had been severly damaged by mining, over-grazing and over-logging. The ski resort, combined with the national forest was a key element in resolving the previous environmental impacts. The USFS had worked to establish numerous small ski resorts during the 1930s and Snow Basin remained a relatively low-key operation until hosting some of the 2002 Winter Olympic Alpine skiing events. \n\nThe main trail for attempting Mt Ogden, Allen, DeMoisy and Strawberry peaks follows the Snow Basin service road up the side up the mountain and cross under the ski lifts. The road starts about 100 feet west of the gondola lift. Trail maps indicating these trails are available in the Grizzly Center. If you feel like you need to get on top of a mountain but don\u2019t really much want to hike, the gondola will take you up to Needles Restaurant near the summits for around $15 on summer weekends. \n\nThe Snow Basin Resort also offers Shuttle Service for hikers and bikers on summer Saturdays and Sundays. The price of the Shuttle is included in your gondola ticket or bike rental. Shuttle stops and times are: Pineview Trailhead 11:00 AM and 3:00 PM and Middle Fork Trailhead 11:45 AM and 3:45 PM. \n\nThe main trail for Sardine is located next to the north lower parking lot. It looks like an abandoned dirt road and is blocked to vehicular traffic by a gate. This area is excellent for snowshoeing and is groomed for cross-country skiing (no charge) in the winter. It proceeds about a half mile to Maples picnic area and then onto the USFS trail to Sardine Peak. \n\nThe area is popular with mountain bikes and horse riders in the summer and snowshoe/Nordic skiers in the winter. The area is normally quiet without too large of herds of people in the summer. Wintertime the area gets crowded on weekends. \n\nThere aren\u2019t any formal camping sites in the general area, although once into the USFS area there are a couple of spots for primitive camping. Use established fire rings whenever possible and practice \u201cleave no trace\u201d camping. Obviously, no camping is allowed in the resort area.

Lee's activities (including his homestead and farm), mining and other commercial history. Trails and interpretive sites, a modern campground, parking areas for river runners, a put-in ramp for rafts, etc. are all administered by the National Park Service as part of the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. The river canyon itself below Lee's Ferry is administered by Grand Canyon National Park. The Navajo Bridge Visitor Center\u00a0at Navajo Bridge is the place to stop for information concerning the area. The Visitor Center is open from mid-April to mid-October, but the Navajo Bridges (the modern one and an unused earlier version) can be visited all year. Further information can be obtained at www.nps.gov.\nCampground:\u00a0A 54-site campground with charcoal grills, restrooms and potable water operates year-round (small fee charged). Some group sites are there, and all sites have a shaded picnic table (you'll be glad to have shade in the summer months). Most sites have also a wind-screen for the rare occasion of a strong down-canyon wind. The campground may fill in prime times (esp spring - river runners; and fall).\u00a0Trails:A system of easy trails tours the historic structures in the area - trail guides are available. An informal riverside trail also exists along the north bank a short distance upriver. One can hike any distance up the Paria River corridor trail (45 miles or 72.4 km one-way). This trail starts in an area farmed by Lee and eventually crosses the border into Utah and ends at highway 89. Overnight use requires a permit. The Cathedral Wash trail (~1.25 mile or 2 km one-way) proceeds from the Lee's Ferry road to the Colorado River. The trailhead is ~2km from the junction with highway 89a. The Spencer Trail begins as a branch from the river trail near Lee's Ferry Fort and climbs about 1560' (~475m) up the cliff to the plateau edge with spectacular views of the area. The trail is not maintained and can be difficult to follow. Do not hike it in the dark.\nMiscellaneous practical comments:\u00a0When to visit: One can visit year-round, but the summer days are baking hot. Winters are tolerable and the time of lowest use. In times of rain (esp. summer monsoonal rains), the trails can be dangerous due to flash-flooding.\nStop at Navajo Bridge Visitor Center (in season) to orient yourself and get your questions answered. For those who intend to use the campground: Although the evenings can be very pleasant (for stargazing, silence, etc.), this can be eroded a bit if someone fires up their electrical generator (apparently permitted by rules). The ground is typical desert pavement - with a considerable rock component. Driving tent stakes can be difficult or impossible. Although it can be tempting to sleep on the ground outside a tent, there are some potentially nasty life forms active at night. These include harvester ants (very common in the campground) which sting as well as bite. A cot is recommended. On several of my stays, I've slept very well on the picnic table.\u00a0\nNearby Attractions:\u00a0A partial list includes\u00a0(1) North & South Rims of the\u00a0Grand Canyon. (2)\u00a0House Rock Valley: US 89 passes through this scenic desert grassland between Jacob Lake (N Rim) and Marble Canyon. \"House Rock\" is a point on the map where Forest Road 1065 branches north from highway 89 - a few buildings mark the junction. A few miles north along this graded dirt road is an interpretive & viewing site where one has a good chance of spotting\u00a0California condors. Forest Road 8910 branches south of highway 89 (further east) and eventually reaches trailheads that serve to descend into Marble Canyon or climb the Kaibab Plateau. For example,\u00a0Buck Farm viewpoint\u00a0(Marble Canyon) and the\u00a0Saddle Mountain Wilderness Area\u00a0are accessed from road 8910.

Thus, the River emerges from the towering walls of Glen Canyon, and it also begins to cut down into the Marble Platform, forming Marble Canyon (considered to be the start of the Grand Canyon). The river widens and bends here following a monocline. Glen Canyon cliffs peel away to the south (eventually becoming the Echo Cliffs), and to the west (immediately turning up the Paria River Canyon). West of the Paria River canyon, the Vermilion Cliffs (lining the Paria Plateau) stretch into the distance. Here also at Lee's Ferry is the confluence with the unimpressive little muddy Paria River, which carries sediments washed from younger rocks at its headwaters: the Paunsaugunt Plateau (including Bryce Canyon) in Utah. While the Colorado River flow is highly regulated by releases from Glen Canyon Dam some miles upstream, the Paria River can become a ferocious torrent after rains. As mentioned, trout fishing is good in the river upstream of the confluence with the Paria River. Below the confluence, the water's sediment load and lowering oxygen concentration make the river much less suitable for the trout.\n", "Lee's Ferry - overview\u00a0": "\n            From prehistory, the site of Lee's Ferry was the only practical crossing point of the Colorado River for about 600 miles (~970km), the river both upstream (Glen Canyon) and downstream (Marble Canyon) being deeply entrenched in cliff-walled canyons. This natural fording site was first recorded in written history by the Dominguez and Velez de Escalante expedition of 1776. Their party was directed here in consultation with natives and attempted (and failed) to cross. Later, the area was explored by Mormon scouts - especially Jacob Hamblin, and John D. Lee eventually settled here (he called it \"Lonely Dell\"). He established ferry service in 1872 - which operated for 55 years. The crossing at Lee's Ferry was obviated by the construction of Navajo Bridge (completed in 1929), which crossed Marble Canyon some miles downriver. The area is rich in history, including that of the Major John Wesley Powell expeditions, and is well summarized in W.L. Rusho's book \"Lee's Ferry - Desert River Crossing.\"Lee's Ferry is the starting point for river trips through the Grand Canyon - in prime times of spring and fall, the place is abuzz with excitement with those embarking. The cold, clear water released from deep penstocks of Glen Canyon Dam a few miles upstream make this short stretch of Colorado River a \"Blue Ribbon\" trout fishery famous among the western United States. The area also has geological and scenery attraction to hikers who try the area trails.\nmap of Lee's Ferry area, ARIZONA\nHow to get there:\u00a0One can approach from the north\u00a0or the south. If the Grand Canyon is your primary visit objective, Lee's Ferry is easy to find (indeed, it is the beginning of the Grand Canyon). Lee's Ferry is a short spur from the most direct road route between the North Rim (Kaibab Plateau) and the South Rim (Coconino Plateau).\u00a0From the north: take US Highway 89 south or east from Kanab, Utah. The most direct way is south to the hamlet of Jacob Lake (as if going to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon). Just keep following 89 eastward from Jacob Lake to Navajo Bridge (distance ~41 miles or 67 km) and follow the sign.

The intersection is well marked. Turn right and continue uphill paralleling the Middle Fork of Beaver Creek for three miles to the City of Colorado Springs reservoir system gate closure. Do not proceed past the gate as the area is off limits to preserve the city's drinking water supply.\r\n\r\nForest Road 376 is maintained by the City and typically is accessible by two wheel drive. There are multiple opportunities for camping along Forest Road 376.\r\n\r\nThe gate closure is just north of a four way intersection just over three miles north of Gold Camp Road. The 4-wheel drive road to the left (west) ends in Bull Park. The 4-wheel drive road to the right (east) is not recommended for vehicle traffic but passes through Elk Park, Deer Park, High Park and eventually Frosty's Park where it connects with Forest Road 376.

Here the entire upper reaches of the South Fork of the Stanislaus River open up. Views of Cooper Peak, Castle Peak, and the Three Chimneys are excellent. A short distance away(1.5miles) Powell Lake offers a nice swimming hole. Chewing Gum Lake is another nice destination for those looking for a moderate dayhike(3.4miles). There are endless opportunities for multiday hikes from Gianelli Cabin, try heading toward Long Lake(10miles), Deer Lake(11miles), or Emigrant Lake(15miles) for some solitude, fishing, and excellent swimming/cliff diving. These can also be reached from the Crabtree Trailhead.\r\n\r\nThe trailhead is usually accessible staring in late June to early July.

It is a well maintained but not an overly crowded trailhead.  Normally there are only a couple of cars in the lot except on weekends.  The North Canyon Road links North Ogden from the West to Liberty and Pineview Reservoir to the East. \r\n\r\nThe North Ogden Divide Trailhead is a trailhead for all seasons linking the South Skyline, North Skyline and Pioneer Trails.  North and South Skyline are part of the Great Western Trail system (a 4,500 mile adventure right up the Mountain States!).  There are 5 summits in the area; Ben Lomond (8.2 miles on North Skyline), Willard Peak (11.5 miles on North Skyline) Chilly Peak (4.5 miles on North Skyline), Eyrie 8136 (3.1 miles on South Skyline) and Lewis Peak (5.5 miles on South Skyline).  In addition to the major peaks, there are a bunch of lesser, but still worthy highpoints like 8246 (3.5 miles on North Skyline and 8110 (2.9 miles on South Skyline).  Pioneer trail goes east/west toward North Ogden and Liberty. I have never hiked it, but it appears to be shady most of the way. Pioneer Trail links with the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. \r\n\r\nThe area trails are unique in that they are open to dirt bikes, snowmobiles and ATVs as well as horses, mountain bikes and hikers.   Both North and South Skyline trails are open in the winter (although the parking lot is blocked with snow) and are good for snowshoeing...cross country skiing would require some skill.  \r\n\r\nThere isn\u2019t a readily available water resupply point on either the North or South Skyline, so you need to bring your own.  Both trails are exposed to the sun for most of the hikes and it gets hot.  \r\n\r\nThere aren\u2019t any formal camping sites in the general area, although there are plenty of spots for primitive camping.  Use established fire rings whenever possible and practice \u201cleave no trace\u201d camping. Once again, lack of water in the area could prove to be a limiting factor. \r\n\r\nThe area around the trailhead is loaded with wildlife including Moose, Deer, Elk, Mountain Goats, Rabbits, squirrels, and the like.  Both eagles and vultures soar above the ridgelines. The area is also a pretty good bird watching area.  Bugs are plentiful but mostly of the non-biting-but-really-annoying variety.

There are Sage Grouse, Fox, Deer, Moose, Owls, Rabbits and Squirrels in the area, so you might get lucky.   On the other hand, keep you ears and eyes open for rattlesnakes as this is a great habitat for them in the spring and summer. \r\n\r\nThe area immediately adjacent to the trail is dry, west facing rocky mountainsides. It takes a little hiking to reach actual \u201cforest\u201d.  In the dry area, flora is mostly sage brush and bunch grass.  During spring/summer, you can find a nice variety of wildflowers. The woods, when you do reach them, are mostly made up of Gambel oak, Canyon Maples, White Pines, and Utah Juniper. \r\n", "Created/Edited": "Jan 2, 2011 / Dec 13, 2011", "Okay...where can I go?": "\u00a0\u00a0\r\n\r\nIndian Trail: A 4.2 mile hike over the hill to Ogden Canyon ---Proceed East from the trailhead and follow the signs/trails up the West face of the mountain.\r\n\r\nHidden Valley: ~3 mile (one way) hike to overlook Taylor Canyon ---Follow Indian Trail up the side of the mountain.
